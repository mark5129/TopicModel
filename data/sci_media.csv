2023,A collaborative communication-less frequency support control for the DRU-HVDC integrated offshore wind farm,"2023 IEEE Sustainable Power and Energy Conference, iSPEC 2023","The utilization of diode rectifier units (DRU) in high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission systems holds significant promise as a cost-effective solution for the integration of large-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs). A collaborative communication-less frequency support (FS) control strategy has been proposed in this paper for OWFs using DRU-HVDC transmission. The onshore-grid frequency change is introduced to the HVDC in the form of a small sinusoidal disturbance and is accurately reflected in offshore grid by the frequency coupling between the AC and the DC side of the DRU. On this basis, the wind turbines (WTs) could realize the FS by measuring the frequency variation of the small disturbance current in the offshore grid. Finally, the results of PSCAD/EMTDC simulation are presented to validate the efficacy of the proposed FS strategy. © 2023 IEEE."
2024,Offshore power and hydrogen networks for Europe's North Sea,Applied Energy,"The European North Sea has a vast renewable energy potential and can be a powerhouse for Europe's energy transition. However, currently there is uncertainty about how much offshore wind energy can be integrated, whether offshore grids should be meshed and to what extent offshore hydrogen should play a role. To address these questions, we use the open-source energy system optimization model PyPSA-Eur to model a European carbon-neutral sector-coupled energy system in high spatial and temporal resolution. We let the model endogenously decide how much offshore wind is deployed and which infrastructure is used to integrate the offshore wind. We find that with point-to-point connections like we have today, 310 GW offshore wind can be integrated in the North Sea. However, if we allow meshed networks and hydrogen, we find that this can be raised to 420 GW with cost savings up to 15 bn€/a. Furthermore, we only observe significant amounts of up to 75 GW of floating wind turbines in the North Sea if we have offshore hydrogen production. Generally, the model opts for offshore wind integration through a mix of both electricity and hydrogen infrastructure. However, the bulk of the offshore energy is transported as hydrogen, which is twice as much as the amount transported as electricity. Moreover, we find that the offshore power network is mainly used for offshore wind integration, with only a small portion used for inter-country transmission. © 2024 The Author(s)"
2024,European Green Deal: Satellite Monitoring in the Implementation of the Concept of Agricultural Development in an Urbanized Environment,Sustainability (Switzerland) ,"To improve energy and environmental security in urban environments and in accordance with the requirements of the EU, the task of sustainable developing agriculture in urban agglomerations and monitoring it using satellite images becomes relevant. The aim of the work is the development of methods and means for determining stable islands of thermal energy to substantiate the optimal locations for plant growing practices in the metropolis. The research was conducted in Kyiv, the largest metropolis of Ukraine. Data from the Landsat 8 and 9 satellites were used because of the free data and they have better spatial resolution and an available archive of observation results. It was established that the temperature map of the city of Kyiv shows differences in temperature between different parts of the city, probably due to the presence of different sources of heat radiation. It is obvious that the standard deviation of the temperature in the plots depends on many factors, in particular, the season and the type of land use. It is necessary to find alternative solutions for the development of crop production in this area, taking into account the characteristics of thermal emissions. Based on software products from free satellite monitoring providers, EO Browser, a specialized software solution (web application) has been created for monitoring agricultural plantations in an urban environment. A collection of LANDSAT 8 satellite images was used. Areas with stable heat emissions were found, which are due to the operation of a modern shopping and entertainment center, and non-traditional crops for landscaping adapted to its design are proposed. As a result of research, strong heat emissions were recorded for some objects, for them the temperature exceeds the surrounding area by 4 °C, while the minimum standard deviation in January is 0.5 °C, the maximum in July is 2.8 °C, in April and October—1.7 °C and 1.2 °C, respectively. © 2024 by the authors."
2024,Designing high-share 50% and 100% renewable energy scenarios for Ragusa by sustainable energy toolkit application,Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,"Increasing renewable energy production and integrating it into the current energy systems may lead to conditional solutions linked to the context of applications as well as regulatory and techno-socioeconomic issues. The PRISMI Plus toolkit is a powerful tool that can be improved to entail rural areas and energy islands for effective planning of the various renewable energy system scenarios associated with urban contexts. The target Flagship Case Study is Ragusa, a Municipality located in Southern Italy, analyzed with the EnergyPLAN software. The simulation and validation were carried out by the HOMER software. The input dataset was created jointly in collaboration with the Municipality, the updated Sustainable Energy Action Plan was inserted into the PRISMI Plus toolkit, and three transition scenarios based on different renewable energy uses were considered within the post-processing stage. For the baseline scenario, no green energy is considered and the whole electricity consumption is taken into account. In scenarios two and three, 50% and 100% renewable energy shares are secured through optimal investment in Photovoltaic (PV) panels, Wind Turbines (WT), and Battery Energy Storage (BES) technologies. From an economic point of view, it was concluded that the best scenario is the second one thanks to the increased technical capacity of the investment ratio compared with the two other scenarios, showing an energy price reduction of up to 10 %. © 2024 The Authors"
2023,Towards positive energy islands – a Danish case study,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"The Danish island of ""Ærø"" has the ambition of becoming the first Danish island to be self-sufficient in renewable energy and CO2 neutral by 2025, as well as fossil fuel free by 2030. This work investigates the feasibility of re-designing part of the island’s energy system to become the first Danish positive energy island (PEI), evaluating various design scenarios and opportunities for improving and modifying the current energy supply and distribution scheme. The district is modelled considering all building specifications and characteristics and the energy supply systems using the urban scale modelling tool City Energy Analyst (CEA). A simulation of the base-case scenario is performed to calibrate the performance. Different energy improvement strategies targeting building envelopes and energy generation and supply systems are created and implemented in CEA. Six improvement packages are created and simulated. It is demonstrated that a PEI could be built in the district under consideration through a comprehensive energy improvement package of envelope-targeting techniques, energy system upgrades, and the expansion of renewable energy systems. The package includes LED lighting, heat pump installation, and photovoltaic-thermal units. This will enable meeting the annual net need for electricity while producing 20% excess heat. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved."
2023,A Methodology for Offshore Transmission System Optimization Considering Spacial Constraints,"2023 IEEE Belgrade PowerTech, PowerTech 2023","This work presents an optimization method for offshore wind transmission networks considering a three di-mensional spacial representation of multiple onshore connection points, bathymetry and no-go zones. The model accounts for capital expenditures (CAPEX) as well as operational expenditures such as cable and transformer losses, corrective maintenance (CM) and expected energy not transmitted (EENT). For accurate determination of operational expenditures, time series of wind generation profiles are used. The methodology combines an original offshore substation (OSS) placement algorithm, a greedy search algorithm of the combinatorial search space and a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model. Two simplifications of the full three dimensional spacial model are presented to increase tractability of large scale test cases. To demonstrate the utility of the approach, the model is applied to the Belgian Exclusive Economic Area (EEA). Results for the full three dimensional problem and the two simplified variations are compared in terms of solution quality and computation time. © 2023 IEEE."
2023,Quasi-Markov Models of Point-Interval Forecasting in Energy Efficiency Management Energy Islands,International Scientific and Technical Conference on Computer Sciences and Information Technologies,"The paper presents a new approach to modeling the processes of dynamic energy efficiency management of energy islands based on long-term point-interval forecasting. The purpose of this work is to present the concept of long-term energy efficiency management of hybrid Energy Islands, as complex systems consisting of a certain number of relatively independent objects - MicroGrids. It is believed that the period of strategic planning from the point of view of the process-resource approach should be long-term (quarter-season-year) with appropriate detailing (for example, decade-month). Therefore, as an effective tool, it is advisable to have a long-term forecast in the form of a certain corridor. Such can be, for example, point-interval forecasts. To obtain such forecasts, the authors proposed a method based on quasi-Markov models. For this, the simple Markov model, as an analog of the autoregressive model of a stationary process 'without delay is extended to the so-called quasi-Markov model, as an analog of the autoregressive model of a stationary process 'with a delay That is, the decision to move to the next state of the object is made taking into account several previous states.

2024,Offshore grid planning considering restricted areas: An evolution game approach,Renewable Energy,"In this paper, offshore wind farm cluster transmission network planning is examined in depth, based on the finite rational evolutionary game method. In the actual project, the game scenarios of offshore wind farm developers and transmission system operators and their respective interests are considered, while cable laying exclusion zones owing to the submarine environment are fully taken into account. Through simulation experiments, the significant effect of the proposed method in improving grid adaptability and interference immunity is verified. The results demonstrate that the proposed finite rational evolutionary game method increases the return on investment by 1.83 % compared to the traditional method, while the payoff ratio of the game participants is 12.81 % lower. In addition, the method excels in ensuring the feasibility of project implementation by successfully balancing the interests between the OWF developer and the power transmission system operator. This offers a new perspective for efficient planning of transmission networks for offshore wind farms that can better cope with complex engineering environments and balance the interests of all parties. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"
2023,Hydro-Pump/Generator-based Hydrogen-Pressure Energy Storage for Power Grid-Forming Support,"2023 3rd New Energy and Energy Storage System Control Summit Forum, NEESSC 2023","This paper presents a method to design water-compressed hydrogen energy storage system (WCH-ESS) and its active regulation function for the power grid. First, it proposed the system architecture of water-compressed hydrogen ESS station. Then, the station operation depends on the variable-speed constant frequency (VSCF) motor/generator as the core function. With the station and core function, the design method of active support function of power grid based on the WCH-ESS is proposed. Finally, the layout, function and risk avoidance design of the WCH-ESS based on an energy island is analyzed. This method can take the discarded wind/photovoltaic energy as the surplus electric energy to drive the motor to compress the hydrogen when the load of the power grid is low. For high-value electric energy, the system adopts the WCH-ESS to generate more power, which can participate in the frequency regulation of power grid to stabilize the power system. It can also be used as emergency backup to improve the consumption rate of wind power and photovoltaic power generation. ©2023 IEEE."
2023,Novel Harmonic Distortion Prediction Methods for Meshed Transmission Grids with Large Amount of Underground Cables †,Energies,"The tremendous and fast green transition in Denmark has initiated the large-scale grid-integration of renewable energy sources, electrification of energy consumption, and establishment of PtX and Energy Islands, setting goals for transmission grid development—such as the establishment of new connections—and for grid reconstruction—such as the extensive substitution of overhead lines (OHLs) with underground cables (UGCs). The share of UGCs in the Danish transmission grid is increasing. Presence of UGC has resulted in that resonances of the harmonic impedance characteristics of the transmission grid are brought within the harmonic order range coinciding with the harmonic emission sources and causing systemwide increase of the harmonic voltage distortion in the 400 kV transmission grid. The transformation of the 400 kV transmission grid has given rise to the need to predict harmonic voltage distortion using simulation models to secure an adequate power quality and support investment decisions and harmonic mitigation for the grid stage, which has not yet been established and which differs from the present grid. This paper presents the experiences of Energinet, the Transmission System Operator (TSO) in Denmark, with harmonic distortion in the Danish transmission grid due to the establishment of 400 kV UGCs, and the development of measurement-validated methods for harmonic distortion simulation and prediction. The paper also presents ongoing developments within, and research addressing, the prediction of harmonic distortion in meshed grids; for example, it explores where and how an analytical approach can replace observational studies with many numerical simulations. The methods shall make it possible to predict whether, where in the transmission grid, and for which harmonic orders connections that have not yet been commissioned may cause the violation of the planning levels, and which mitigations are necessary for bringing the harmonic distortion below the planning levels with respect to a given margin. © 2023 by the authors."

In response to the growing need for effective educational tools in this field, Sustainable Energy Centers of Vocational Excellence (SECOVE) issued a challenge to create a game that would teach the players about sustainable energies while capturing their attention. This project aims to provide an enhanced way for the subject to be taught to students in a class environment while also being prepared to teach people outside of that environment about the subject. To achieve this goal, a multi-phase approach was developed, integrating research, design, and deployment. Games with similar themes, such as “Power Up” and “Siemens Energy Island”, were studied, along with techniques identified to enhance game development. The resulting game was designed to engage players while providing relevant information about renewable energies, their advantages, and their importance. While it was reported to have a strong teaching component and engaging gameplay experience, feedback on the player actions fell short of expectations. Nonetheless, the game holds potential for further development to incorporate reported feedback and expand on existing teaching content. In summary, this research aims to introduce a novel approach to teaching about renewable energies, leveraging familiar technology (games) to captivate a younger audience. © 2024 Digital Transformation and Innovation Management.

2024,Evaluating the offshore wind business case and green hydrogen production: A case study of a future North Sea Offshore Grid,Electric Power Systems Research,"The European Union aims to increase its climate ambition and achieve climate neutrality by 2050. This necessitates expanding offshore wind energy and green hydrogen production, especially for hard-to-abate industrial sectors. A study examines the impact of green hydrogen on offshore wind projects, specifically focusing on a potential future North Sea offshore grid. The study utilizes data from the TYNDP 2020 Global Ambition scenario 2040, considering several European countries. It aims to assess new transmission and generation capacity utilization and understand the influencing factors. The findings show that incorporating green hydrogen production increases offshore wind utilization and capture prices. The study estimates that by 2040, the levelized cost of hydrogen could potentially decrease to €1.2-1.6/kg H2, assuming low-cost electricity supply and declining capital costs of electrolysers. These results demonstrate the potential benefits and cost reductions of integrating green hydrogen production into North Sea offshore wind projects. © 2024 The Author(s)"
2023,Harmonic suppression and fault ride-through method of diode-rectifier-based hybrid high-voltage direct current system for offshore wind farms integration,"IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution","The diode-rectifier (DR)-based high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission is regarded as a low-cost alternative to the HVDC transmission for offshore wind farms (OWFs) integration. However, the DR would generate harmonic voltages in the offshore grid, which greatly affects the power quality. To solve this problem, this paper utilizes a parallel-connected small-capacity auxiliary converter to suppress the harmonic voltages and provide black-start energy for the OWFs. In addition, the submodule branches (SMBs) of the auxiliary converter can be used as part of the HVDC chopper. On this basis, a coordinated grid fault ride-through (FRT) strategy is proposed in this paper. After a grid fault occurs, the HVDC chopper constructed by the auxiliary converter is able to constrain the DC-link voltage. At the same time, the OWFs are controlled to reduce the output active power. As a result, the cost of the FRT can be significantly reduced. The proposed harmonic voltage suppression and the FRT method are verified through the simulation model in Simulink. © 2023 The Authors.

2023,Diode rectifier-based hybrid high-voltage direct current converter for offshore wind farms,IET Renewable Power Generation,"This paper presents a diode rectifier (DR)-based hybrid converter topology for high-voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission system with offshore wind farms (OWFs). The hybrid converter consists of a DR and an auxiliary converter. A high conversion ratio ac/dc converter is designed as the auxiliary converter, which can form the offshore grid voltage for OWFs to achieve black-start. Under steady state, all the active power output from OWFs is delivered through the DR. Meanwhile, the auxiliary converter is able to compensate the reactive power and harmonic currents of the system. Comparing with the conventional modular multilevel converter (MMC), the number of submodules (SM) of the proposed hybrid converter is significantly reduced, which decreases the construction cost and size of the system. The topology and operation principle of the hybrid HVDC converter are introduced. Then the corresponding control strategy is designed to achieve energy balance and power transmission. Based on the mathematic model, a design method for the parameters of the auxiliary converter is proposed. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed hybrid HVDC converter is verified by both the simulation and hardware-in-the-loop experiment results. © 2022 The Authors.

2023,Model predictive control and protection of MMC-based MTDC power systems,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,"Meshed offshore grids (MOGs) present a viable option for a reliable bulk power transmission topology. The station-level control of MOGs requires faster dynamics along with multiple objective functions, which is realized by the model predictive control (MPC). This paper provides control, and protection design for the Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) based multi-terminal DC (MTDC) power system using MPC. MPC is defined using a quadratic cost function, and a dqz rotating frame voltage inputs are represented using Laguerre orthonormal functions. MPC has been applied for the control of both grid forming and grid following converters in a four-terminal MTDC setup, implemented for real-time Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulation. By applying numerous time-domain simulations, the advantages of the MPC when dealing with AC and DC side disturbances are investigated. The investigation highlights the MPC's inherent feature of fast response and high damping during- and post-disturbance, which is compared to the traditional PI controller performance. The analysis provides a comprehensive insight into the transient behavior of the MTDC during disturbances. © 2022 The Author(s)"
2024,Techno-economic assessment of upgraded pyrolysis bio-oils for future marine fuels,Energy Conversion and Management,"Power-to-X plants can generate renewable power and convert it into hydrogen or more advanced fuels for hard-to-abate sectors like the maritime industry. Using the Bornholm Energy Island in Denmark as a study case, this study investigates the off-grid production e-bio-fuel as marine fuels. It proposes a production pathway and an analysis method of the oil with a comparison with e-methanol. Production costs, optimal operations and system sizing are derived using an open-source techno-economic linear programming model. The renewable power source considered is a combination of solar photovoltaic and off-shore wind power. Both AEC and SOEC electrolyzer technologies are assessed for hydrogen production. The bio-fuel is produced by slow pyrolysis of straw pellet followed by an upgrading process: hydrodeoxygenation combined with decarboxylation. Due to its novelty, the techno-economic parameters of the upgraded pyrolyzed oil are derived experimentally. Experimental results highlight that the upgrading reaction conditions of 350 °C for 2h with one step of 1h at 150 °C, under 200 bars could effectively provide a fuel with a sufficient quality to meet maritime fuel specifications. It requires a supply of 0.014 kg H2/ kgbiomass. Modeling results shows that a small scale plant constrained by the local availability of CO2 and biomass producing 71.5 GWh of fuel per year (13.3 kton of methanol or 7.9 kton of bio-fuel), reaches production costs of 54.2 €2019/GJmethanol and 19.3 €2019/GJbio−fuel. In a large scale facility, ten times larger, the production costs are reduced to 44.7 €2019/GJmethanol and 18.9 €2019/GJbio−fuel (scaling effects for the methanol pathway). Results show that, when sustainable biomass is available in sufficient quantities, upgraded pyrolysis oil is the cheapest option and the less carbon intensive (especially thanks to the biochar co-product). The pyrolysis unit represents the main costs but co-products revenues such as district heat sale and biochar as a CO2 credit could decrease the costs by a factor three. © 2024 The Author(s)"
2023,Small Signal Stability Analysis of MMC-HVDC Grid-connected System and Optimization Control of Zero-sequence Circulating Current Controller,"2023 IEEE International Conference on Power Science and Technology, ICPST 2023","The high voltage direct current (HVDC) transmission technology based on modular multilevel converter (MMC) is widely used in the offshore grid-connected wind power generation projects, and the small signal stability problems of the grid-connected system have been attracted great attention. This paper focused on the influence of the zero-sequence circulating current (ZSCC) controller on the stability of the offshore wind power generation MMC-HVDC grid-connected system. The closed-loop frequency domain model was derived by means of complex vectors and harmonic state space firstly. Then the paper developed the single-input-single-output (SISO) impedance model of MMC which considering the ZSCC controller. In addition, the impedance model of the offshore wind farm and the distribution network were established. Based on the impedance model, the influence law and mechanism of the ZSCC controller on the stability of the offshore wind power generation MMC-HVDC grid-connected system were explored. The analysis results show that when the output power of wind is too large, the system is prone to oscillation. The application of the ZSCC controller equivalently increases the bridge arm resistance and enhancing the system damping, which effectively suppressing the resonant peaks of MMC impedance in island control mode. Finally, from the point of view of enhancing the damping of the system, the parameter optimization scheme for ZSCC controller was designed, and the correctness of the theory and the feasibility of the scheme were verified by simulations.  © 2023 IEEE."
2024,"A framework to identify offshore spatial trade-offs in different space allocation options for Offshore Wind Farms, as part of the North Sea Offshore Grid",Energy Reports,"An efficient, well-balanced North Sea Offshore Grid (NSOG) requires an area-based approach for large-scale OWF deployment. However, the essential coordination of environmental, spatial and energy planning at a basin scale is lacking. This study offers a systematic approach for unidirectional coupling of spatially explicit offshore development scenarios potentials(km2), with an integrated energy system model, IESA-NS. Under the NSOG concept, we calculate spatial potentials for 8 predefined energy hubs(clusters). By combining the potential spatial availability, deployment and energy system costs(IESA-NS) and the risk management options (OWFs/fisheries/marine protected areas-MPA), we unfold trade-offs emerging in the planning of the future NSOG. Hence, a lower-cost NSOG, in reaching the North Sea 2050 energy targets, depends on integrated, collaborative space management, fast deployment of fixed-bottom OWFs by 2030(3.5 times the current capacity) and multi-use with static gear fisheries (Cluster 3) and MPAs (Cluster 7). Alternatively, a higher-cost NSOG with lower impacts on the MPAs and fisheries, is highly dependent on floating OWFs (32.6GWs by 2030), from 2 British NSOG clusters. In both cases, floating OWFs are essential, the effective use of cluster space requires basin-scale collaboration (Cluster 7-Dogger Bank), and the untapped potential of Cluster 8(floating OWFs) can lower the pressure on other NSOG clusters. © 2024 The Authors"

2023,Well-to-Wheels for Light-Duty Vehicle Powertrains by Segments in Isolated Systems †,Energies,"The transportation sector has the highest energy demand worldwide and bears the primary responsibility for CO2 emissions. Electromobility has emerged as the most feasible way to alleviate this problem. However, its potential depends heavily on the development of renewable energies. Island regions raise additional barriers to electromobility due to their heavy dependence on fossil fuels. This article addresses this challenge by presenting a comprehensive well-to-wheel framework to assess the levels of efficiency and CO2 emissions of electromobility options such as battery and plug-in electric vehicles (BEVs and PHEVs). The results were compared with those for internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs). The framework proposed takes account of various factors including the extraction, refining, and transport of oil, different segments of land vehicles, and electricity system operations. The framework is demonstrated with a case study of the Spanish Canary archipelago. The results show that BEVs improve efficiency and CO2 emissions by around 30% compared to ICEVs on islands where the share of renewable energies is higher than 21%. In contrast, limited renewable generation may lead to BEVs polluting up to 15% more than ICEVs. PHEVs should be considered as a suitable alternative if the share of renewable generation is higher than 35%. © 2023 by the authors."

As a promising green energy technology，renewable energy electrolysis of water to produce hydrogen has attracted widespread attention. China has abundant offshore wind energy resources；however，there are currently challenges in grid connection，transmission，and high costs.

2023,Research on indoor dynamic temperature based on circulating water heating,Energy Reports,"During the heating season, cities in northeast China primarily emphasize the implementation of large-scale CHP central heating systems. However, the heat-electricity constraints associated with these heating units hinder the integration of clean energy sources such as wind power, photovoltaic, and other renewable energies. Despite efforts to reduce carbon emissions and address concerns related to urban haze formation, energy conservation, and emission reduction, coal remains the predominant energy source for heating. In light of these challenges, this paper aims to investigate the heat transfer characteristics of buildings during the heating season. It also examines the feasibility of implementing heating regulations and provides a theoretical foundation for establishing a regional heat model that incorporates low-carbon energy islands. The proposed model combines wind power, photovoltaic power generation, and other renewable energy sources supplemented with coal power. By employing the concentrated heat capacity method, this study develops a mathematical model to simulate the dynamic thermal process involved in heating buildings. The model encompasses various components, including the dynamic heat transfer model of the building's envelope structure, which considers its heat storage characteristics, as well as the radiator model and the indoor air heat balance equation. Furthermore, the model comprehensively accounts for the influence of different indoor and outdoor disturbances on the heat transfer process, including the effects of solar radiation. To validate the model, a simulation program is implemented using Matlab. This program is capable of hourly calculations to determine the indoor temperature. By comparing the simulated temperature values with the measured ones, the rationality and accuracy of the model are verified. © 2023 The Author(s)"

Continuous knowledge creation that can be shared between the industries and among the affected peripheral communities that frame the bridging of the two industries is therefore needed. This is particularly the case for Bornholm, a Danish island in the Baltic Sea with a strong tourism tradition and profile but challenged by a new development of turning the island into one of the first community-based “energy islands” in the world. Based on a short literature overview and supported with opinions from local tourism and energy representatives, the research note bases itself around this knowledge need and uses the situation on Bornholm to confirm existing knowledge on the topic, but also uses the occasion to introduce new knowledge aspects that have not yet received attention in the literature.

2023,Analyzing the impact of demand response and reserves in islands energy planning,Energy,"Small Islands usually rely on fossil fuels for their energy supply and face common challenges such as high energy costs and carbon dioxide emissions. For these reasons they represent interesting cases for analysing the transition towards a clean and secure energy system. Nevertheless, integrating non-dispatchable Renewable Energy Sources in the power grid causes stability issues and this is particularly true for island grids. Such issue is not fully considered in long-term energy planning; indeed, an important factor that should be considered in order to ensure the reliability of the grid are Reserves. There are different types of Reserves depending on the reactiveness/response time and the duration of the service. In this paper, primary and secondary reserves have been analysed in order to plan the long-term energy transition of the small island of Favignana, Italy by means of the new version of H2RES, a Linear Programming single-objective optimisation model able to provide a long-term capacity investment and dispatching optimisation. It has been found that biomass generators are favoured to both photovoltaic and wind turbines for their ability to provide reserves and also decrease the unpredictability of the supply. Batteries and Electrolysers are also used mostly for reserve provision. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
2023,How to connect energy islands: Trade-offs between hydrogen and electricity infrastructure,Applied Energy,"In light of offshore wind expansions in the North and Baltic Seas in Europe, further ideas on using offshore space for renewable-based energy generation have evolved. One of the concepts is that of energy islands, which entails the placement of energy conversion and storage equipment near offshore wind farms. Offshore placement of electrolysers will cause interdependence between the availability of electricity for hydrogen production and for power transmission to shore. This paper investigates the trade-offs between integrating energy islands via electricity versus hydrogen infrastructure. We set up a combined capacity expansion and electricity dispatch model to assess the role of electrolysers and electricity cables given the availability of renewable energy from the islands. We find that the electricity system benefits more from connecting close-to-shore wind farms via power cables. In turn, electrolysis is more valuable for far-away energy islands as it avoids expensive long-distance cable infrastructure. We also find that capacity investment in electrolysers is sensitive to hydrogen prices but less to carbon prices. The onshore network and congestion caused by increased activity close to shore influence the sizing and siting of electrolysers. © 2023 The Author(s)"
2023,Simulating wake losses of the Danish Energy Island wind farm cluster,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"The increase in the number of installed offshore wind farms has led to clustering, where wind farm interaction can cause energy losses. The Danish government is planning an Energy Island in the North Sea consisting of ten 1 GW wind farms. The initial wind farm layout design from a consultant company (COWI) has reported a 5% annual energy production (AEP) wake loss based on a low-fidelity engineering wake model that is known to underestimate wind farm interaction. The present work employs higher-fidelity wake models based on Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) and a mesoscale model, which predict higher AEP losses due to wind farm interaction; namely, between 8.6-10.1%. In addition, we investigate how a microscale model as RANS can be employed to simulate a large wind farm cluster efficiently, and we compare its results with mesoscale model simulations.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
2024,Lithuanian Energy Security Transition: The Evolution of Public Concern and Its Socio-Economic Implications,Energies,"The article analyses the evolution of the social dimension in energy security transition in Lithuania. It contributes to an emerging attempt in the literature to broaden the horizons of our understanding of societal transformation and energy transitions. The analysis reveals the interdependence of changing Lithuanian society and its developing energy security concerns throughout the Independence period, from the importance of material threats (ecological, economic, and political) to post-material values (such as climate change concerns) in the context of energy security. Accordingly, the energy sector undergoes a vivid transition from a totally dependent “Energy Island” to a diversified, interconnected, and self-sustainable system. Such a journey inevitably resulted in the highlight of the social dimension in energy security and provoked certain socio-economic implications, like changing public awareness and participation, social equity and justice, and socio-economic resilience and vulnerability. The research is based on case study principles (applying sociological discourse analysis through scientific articles’ qualitative content analysis method as well as energy security policy analysis reviewing all national strategies throughout the Independence period) and is focused on a unique Lithuanian context. © 2024 by the authors."
2024,Modeling and optimal operation of reversible solid oxide cells considering heat recovery and mode switching dynamics in microgrids,Applied Energy,"The reversible solid oxide cell (rSOC) is a promising technology for advancing energy decarbonization by enabling bidirectional conversion between electricity and hydrogen in a single device. However, previous studies have not fully explored the operational flexibility of rSOCs due to inadequate consideration of heat recovery potentials and dynamics of operating mode transitions. To address this research gap, this paper presents a model-based optimal operation method for managing multi-energy transactions in rSOC-based microgrids, aiming to minimize operation costs. The method incorporates detailed operational models of the rSOC, including a lumped thermal model to account for heat recovery capability and modeling of various operating modes and their transitions. Additionally, a linearization process is introduced to address nonlinear and implicit operational constraints, resulting in a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation for the operation model. Comparative case studies are conducted using modified energy portfolios of a Danish energy island. The results demonstrate that the proposed method effectively captures operating mode transitions within the rSOC and enhances its profitability via waste heat recovery. Notably, the rSOC model contributes to enhanced operational flexibility through heat recovery behaviors and a wider temperature range, resulting in substantial economic savings for the microgrid. © 2023"
2024,AC Fault Ride-Through Method of HVDC Interconnector for Islanded AC Grid With Offshore Wind Farm and Loads,IEEE Access,"This paper proposes an ac fault ride-through (FRT) method for high-voltage dc (HVDC) transmission systems that serve as an interconnector between the onshore ac grid and an islanded offshore ac grid. In conventional HVDC systems for offshore wind farms FRT is realized by consuming excess power with braking resistors. However, the same method cannot be applied if the offshore ac grid includes not only wind farms but also various loads, which are being considered for integration into multipurpose interconnectors or energy islands. In this article, a novel FRT method based on voltage control for HVDC interconnectors operating with bidirectional power flow is proposed. The proposed method curtails the ac voltage formed by the offshore converter according to the converter's dc current and voltage. The effectiveness of the proposed FRT method is established through experiments on a mini model.  © 2013 IEEE."
2023,"Granite thermal reservoirs in Lingshui area of Hainan Island and their significance to geothermal resources, China",Energy Geoscience,"Hainan Island located at the southernmost tip of the continental crust of the South China Plate, has high terrestrial heat-flow values, widely-distributed hot springs, and rich geothermal resources. Intensified researches on the origin and potentials of geothermal resources can promote Hainan Island's development into a clean energy island. To determine the geological conditions for the formation of geothermal resources in southern Hainan Island, we collected core samples of granites from the Baocheng batholith in southern Hainan Island and conducted systematic analysis in respect of petrology, geochronology, geochemistry, and petrophysical property. The results of this study are as follows. The Baocheng batholith in the southern Hainan Island has a crystallization age of 98.42 ± 0.56 Ma, making it the product of magmatism in the early stage of the Late Cretaceous. It mainly consists of high-K calc-alkaline granites, which were intruded by intermediate-to-mafic veins. The Baocheng batholith has a high radioactive heat generation rate of 2.712–6.843 μW/m3, with an average of 3.846 μW/m3, a radioactive heat-flow value of 30.768 mW/m2 and a heat-flow contribution rate of 38.95%–43.95%. As shown by the results of their thermophysical property analysis, the granites have high thermal conductivity and can serve as high-quality geothermal reservoirs. In combination with previous geological and geophysical data, the geothermal model of the Lingshui area was established in this study. The deep structure indicates the presence of high-conductivity and low-resistivity layers in the basement of the Baocheng batholith. It can be inferred thereby that asthenospheric upwelling may occur and that there exist two magma vents at depth in the batholith. Therefore, magmatic heat at depth and granites with high radioactive heat generation rate serve as the main heat sources in the Lingshui area. © 2023 Sinopec Petroleum Exploration and Production Research Institute"
2024,Maritime law enforcement concerning offshore energy platforms: Navigating international law constraints and challenges,Marine Policy,"Offshore energy platforms (OEPs) serve as a crucial frontier in utilizing renewable energy sources to meet energy demands, powering essential maritime operations such as remote island power supply, offshore oil and gas exploration, seawater desalination, and marine renewable energy harvesting. However, the development of OEPs raises significant legal concerns for maritime law enforcement. Employing a policy analysis approach, this research delves into the multifaceted challenges faced by the current international legal framework in regulating enforcement activities pertaining to OEPs. These challenges encompass ambiguity in OEP legal status, difficulties in balancing safety measures with diverse maritime interests, obstacles in environmental assessment and enforcement, and heightened enforcement challenges in areas beyond national jurisdiction. The study explores potential strategies for resolution and collaboration on an international scale. Through this investigation, the study aims to provide valuable insights to promote greater clarity and coherence in maritime law enforcement practices concerning OEPs, thereby enhancing safety, security, and environmental sustainability for OEP operations in maritime environments globally. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"
2023,Grid-forming control for the linear-generator-based wave energy converter for the electrification of remote islands,IET Conference Proceedings,"The development of wave energy technology has advanced significantly, and its grid connection and power optimization stages have been an area of research. Various grid connection schemes have been thoroughly researched and are being implemented, while grid-following control has emerged as the primary technique for power transfer to the grid. Energy storage solutions such as batteries and supercapacitors have been incorporated to mitigate the intermittency effect of wave energy. However, with the increase of renewable energy in the grid leading to a low-inertia power grid, wave energy must be equipped with grid-ready capabilities to achieve commercial success. This study proposes a wave-to-wire model for a wave energy converter array in a grid-forming application, enabling the supply of power to remote islands. The results of this research propose the control mechanisms required for the successful integration of wave energy to form a grid and transmit a continuous power supply. © The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2023."
2023,"Decarbonizing energy islands with flexibility-enabling planning: The case of Santiago, Cape Verde: Decarbonizing Energy Islands with Flexibility-Enabling Planning",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"The growing interest in fully decarbonizing worldwide energy systems requires abandoning traditional generation expansion planning in favour of other flexibility-enabling energy system planning tools allowing the integration of energy storage and sector coupling. Therefore, this paper proposes a mixed-integer linear programming formulation focused on enabling flexibility provision on integrated energy systems targeting independent sizing of power and energy capacities for simultaneous generation and storage expansion planning. The optimization problem minimizes investment, maintenance, operation and emissions costs over a 20 year horizon with hourly resolution. In this context, islands represent suitable study cases for the energy transition due to their exceptional renewable availability, and fast-paced development; despite being regions with extreme external dependence and isolation. In particular, the island of Santiago, Cape Verde is selected as study case given its existing targets regarding reaching 50 and 100% renewable shares in 2030 and 2040, its data availability, and the extreme seasonal variation in wind and solar resources. Four scenarios are considered. The first and second dismiss flexibility: business as usual (BAU), and another one aligned with the government goals (Green). Then, the other two exploit it: one equivalent to Green, FlexG, and a last one finding the Optimal. In addition, three energy demand growth levels are considered in order to reduce uncertainty, corresponding to 1, 3 and 5%. Last, a sensitivity analysis with three additional scenarios is performed to provide a thorough view of Cape Verde's energy future. The results highlight the importance of flexibility exploitation which provides up to 85% savings and allows to decarbonize other sectors via electrification. © 2023 The Author(s)"
2024,Review of Grid Code Requirements for Cost Optimization of Offshore Energy Hubs,IET Conference Proceedings,"In this paper, a review of grid code requirements (GCRs) applicable to wind power plants (WPPs) connected to energy islands, i.e., offshore energy hubs (OEHs), is presented. The main GCRs analysed are based on the impact they may have in the reduction of costs associated to the WPP based on a recommended optimization of the OEH. OEHs are currently developed and planned in the North and Baltic Seas, with an ambition to reach a capacity of over 300 GW by 2050. GCRs from European transmission system operators (TSOs), such as ENTSO-E, National Grid, ELIA and Energinet are reviewed and compared, giving particular attention to projects such as future OEHs, i.e., Princess Elisabeth by ELIA and Bornholm by Energinet and 50Hertz. The main GCRs analysed are, among others, voltage ranges, post-fault active power recovery and emergency power control. The relaxation of such requirements may bring positive cost optimization of the WPPs connected to the OEH. Furthermore, ancillary services such as grid-forming capability and inertia provision are reviewed, and recommendations towards additional revenue to the WPP operator are given. Overall, relaxation and/or shifting of GCRs may be possible and a good compromise for the TSOs, WPP operators and society. © Energynautics GmbH."
2023,Installation of Sectionalizers in a Radial Distribution Networks to Create an Emergency Islanded Network Powered by Distributed Generators During Outages,"Proceedings of the 5th International Conference on Modern Electrical and Energy System, MEES 2023","The paper considers the use of sectionalizers to isolate a damaged section of a medium voltage (MV) radial power network of 6-10 kV and create energy islanded network that can be powered by distributed generators (DGs). The configuration of power networks with one and two sectionalizers and a different number of DGs, which are separated over the network zones, is considered. To avoid the use of labor-intensive discrete calculations, the authors propose a simplified method for calculating the reduction of the expected energy not-supplied (EENS) to the consumers due to create energy islanded network. This method suggests replacing discrete load distribution with a standard function. All calculations come down to selecting the load distribution function and obtaining the result from the tables (placement of the sectionalizer and the EENS in this case). The table is easy to use when designing to find the optimal location for installing a sectionalizer in a power network. © 2023 IEEE."
2023,MPC-VSG Based Control Strategy for Dynamic Stability of Frequency and Voltage in Islanded Microgrid; [基于 MPC-VSG 的孤岛微电网频率和电压动态稳定控制策略],Zhongguo Dianli/Electric Power,"In a high proportion of new energy islanded microgrids, the reduction in the proportion of conventional synchronous generator (SG) will lead to a gradual decrease in their overall inertia. The conventional control strategy cannot effectively coregulate the frequency and voltage in microgrid under low inertia conditions. To simultaneously improve the dynamic stability of the frequency and voltage in the islanded microgrid, this paper proposes a model predictive control (MPC) based frequency-voltage control strategy for energy storage virtual synchronous generator (VSG). By developing a predictive model of VSG, a cost function of frequency and power is designed, and the power reference value of VSG is dynamically corrected after calculating the required active and reactive power increments. Considering that the interaction between SG and VSG reduces the transient voltage stability of the system, the voltage control loop is improved by reducing the angular difference between SG and VSG during transients, and the reactive power reference value is further adjusted. The dynamic stability control of the system frequency and voltage is achieved based on the power reference value. Finally, the simulation results verify the effectiveness of the strategy and the superiority. © 2023 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press. Ltd. All rights reserved."
2024,A coordination failure between EU climate policies exemplified by the North Sea energy island,Climate Policy,"We highlight a coordination problem between the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) and the EU's offshore renewable energy strategy. We exemplify this coordination failure by analyzing carbon leakage effects associated with Denmark's planned North Sea energy island. The Danish energy island project will not start production before 2033, implying a long interval between project announcement and production. Using a dynamic model of the EU ETS, we show that the large time gap between announcement and production likely results in a ‘Green Paradox’, where the energy island increases aggregate EU ETS emissions. The mechanism leading to the emission increase is complicated and works through the Market Stability Reserve (MSR). The estimated 2050 leakage rate is 145 percent in our main scenario and not below 100 percent in any alternative scenario. We discuss how to improve the climate benefits of the energy island or similar large-scale renewable energy projects. This includes possible revisions to the EU ETS and the role of Power-to-X technologies. © 2023 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2024,Vision of Offshore Energy Hub at Faroe Islands: The Market Equilibrium Impact,International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management,"This study examines the integration of an offshore wind farm and green hydrogen production as a strategy to enhance the Faroe Islands’ energy independence and reduce its carbon footprint. Utilizing the EnergyPLAN tool and market economic simulations, including Levelized Cost of Hydrogen and Net Present Value calculations, the research evaluates the economic viability and environmental impact of transitioning to renewable energy sources by 2030. The analysis explores various scenarios, ranging from dedicated offshore wind for in-turbine hydrogen production to platform-based electricity and hydrogen distribution. Results indicate that integrating offshore wind with green hydrogen production can significantly reduce CO2 emissions and dependency on imported fossil fuels. However, financial viability hinges on supportive mechanisms such as investment subsidies. The study’s findings suggest that achieving economic feasibility requires strategic policy frameworks.

2023,Going offshore or not: Where to generate hydrogen in future integrated energy systems?,Energy Policy,"Hydrogen can be key in the energy system transition. We investigate the role of offshore hydrogen generation in a future integrated energy system. By performing energy system optimisation in a model application of the Northern-central European energy system and the North Sea offshore grid towards 2050, we find that offshore hydrogen generation may likely only play a limited role, and that offshore wind energy has higher value when sent to shore in the form of electricity. Forcing all hydrogen generation offshore would lead to increased energy system costs. Under the assumed scenario conditions, which result in deep decarbonisatiton of the energy system towards 2050, hydrogen generation – both onshore and offshore – follows solar PV generation patterns. Combined with hydrogen storage, this is the most cost-effective solution to satisfy future hydrogen demand. Overall, we find that the role of future offshore hydrogen generation should not simply be derived from minimising costs for the offshore sub-system, but by also considering the economic value that such generation would create for the whole integrated energy system. We find as a no-regret option to enable and promote the integration of offshore wind in onshore energy markets via electrical connections. © 2023 The Authors"

This article compares the legal frameworks of the coastal states on three main issues: the location choice, including selection of developers; the permitting procedures, and the connection of the owf s.

2023,Technological learning potential of offshore wind technology and underlying cost drivers,Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,"Detailed analysis of technological learning of energy technologies is scarce. For floating wind, this is missing altogether. In this study, we applied experience curve and bottom-up cost modeling methodologies and assessed the long-term cost reduction potential and contribution factors of fixed-bottom and floating offshore wind in their mature markets. Further, to emphasize the role of strongly varying site characteristics of offshore wind farms and their influences, the grid connection cost is separately discussed from the total technology costs (Capital Expenditure and LCOE). Our assessment shows that, excluding grid connection costs, fixed-bottom offshore wind LCOE is 40 €/MWh at 31 GW cumulative capacity (2023–2024) and decline to 28 ± 3 €/MWh by 100 GW. Floating wind LCOE is 123 €/MWh at 1 GW cumulative capacity (2027 – 2030) but decline to 33 ± 6 €/MWh by 100 GW. Moreover, floating wind can achieve cost parity (i.e., 40 €/MWh, excl. grid connection cost) by deploying 21 GW, requiring 44 billion € of learning investment in the form of subsidies to compensate the price gap for the technology in the energy system. We also conclude that grid cost forms a substantial portion of total offshore wind cost, and an integrated offshore grid can efficiently future wind farms and reduce costs. Lastly, we compared our assessment with literature and found that fixed-bottom cost developments are commonly underestimated and the near-term developments for floating wind are overestimated due to limited understanding of component-level cost developments and developing financing conditions. © 2023 The Author(s)"
2023,Conceptual Design of a Floating Modular Energy Island for Energy Independency: A Case Study in Crete,Energies,"This paper aims to investigate the development of a floating artificial sustainable energy island at a conceptual design level that would enhance the energy independence of islands focusing on a case study on the island of Crete. This paper provides a baseline assessment showing the immense potential of wind and solar energy in and around Crete integrating the third significant renewable energy source (RES) of ocean waves into the energy island. The selection of the best location for the floating offshore platforms that compose the energy island is addressed through exploiting the great potential of the above-mentioned RES, taking into consideration criteria with regard to several significant human activities. To this end, the concept of an innovative floating modular energy island (FMEI) that integrates different renewable energy resources is proposed; in addition, a case study that focuses on the energy independency of a big island illustrates the concept referring to the substitution of the local thermal power plants that are currently in operation in Crete with sustainable energy power.

2024,Re-thinking Short-Circuit Current Contribution from Type IV Wind Turbines: A Perspective into How Standardization Can Be Improved,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,"Discussions on short-circuit current (SCC) contributions from type IV wind turbines and other inverter-based resources (IBRs) are becoming more relevant and common as power systems are more and more penetrated by renewable energy sources. Several works have brought attention to the fact that IBRs do not behave entirely as a fixed current source during faults as some standards have proposed so far. In contrast, they behave as voltage- and grid-code-dependent current sources in the fault steady-state and can be highly non-linear during the fault transient stage, which increases the complexity of estimating SCC contributions. This paper presents a new perspective on how the improvement of standards and guidelines can help establish effective and intellectual property-independent approaches to estimate SCC contributions from type IV generators. To base the discussion, results from field-validated EMT models of a large-scale offshore grid-following wind turbine are shown in simulations that demonstrate the need for standardized procedures.  © 2024 IEEE."
2023,Benefits from Islanding Hydrogen Production in Renewable Energy Systems,"International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM","The sustainable transition to a net-zero economy may require large quantities of low-cost clean hydrogen. In a fully renewable energy system, coproduction of electricity and green hydrogen may provide synergies (such as flexible demand, reduced renewables curtailment). On the other hand, separating electricity and hydrogen production could offer advantages (such as better renewable resources and less onerous power quality requirements for power electronics). We quantify the potential synergies of ""integrated""electricity and hydrogen production versus stand-alone (""islanded"") production of hydrogen in systems entirely powered by wind and solar. We explore the trade-offs for several countries, including Germany, Spain, Chile, Australia and the United Kingdom, in a simple six-node model that enhances analytical understanding. Our findings show that integrated hydrogen production is the lowest cost solution when hydrogen demand is low (less than 20% of final energy). At high shares of hydrogen demand (80% of final energy), islanding electrolysers can result in system cost reductions of up to 9%. These results are especially relevant for countries that export hydrogen, as it suggests that they should deploy electrolysers primarily in islanded settings.  © 2023 IEEE."

2023,Optimal planning of energy and water systems of a small island with a hourly OSeMOSYS model,Energy Conversion and Management,"Islands all over the world face common challenges connected to energy costs and greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, islands have been identified as perfect sites for implementing and testing innovative solutions to boost the green energy transition towards a sustainable and clean energy system. The supply of clean water is a major issue that affects small islands, and desalination, particularly Reverse Osmosis, represents a valid solution to this challenge. In this research, an energy system model is used to analyse long-term water and energy supply strategies of the tourist island of Favignana, Italy. The model is built with the Open Source long-term energy modelling tool OSeMOSYS at an hourly resolution. It considers both the potential synergies offered by Reverse Osmosis Desalination and the use of water storage to store the excess electricity when needed. The indirect emissions for the maritime transportation of goods and fuels (i.e., water and diesel) to the island are also accounted for. Different energy policies are compared to understand how a carbon tax, a limit on emissions and no policy would impact the long-term energy strategy of the island. The results show that a carbon tax that covers also the maritime transportation sector would lead to the lowest overall cumulative emissions. They additionally reveal that the contribution of emissions for maritime transportation of goods and fuels is relevant and cannot be neglected if a full decarbonisation has to be achieved. On the technological side, investment in a desalination plant is the most viable option in all cases. Finally, for the first time, OSeMOSYS is applied with hourly resolution and the results are compared with those obtained with lower time resolution showing that inaccuracies are found both for overall values and for the dispatching strategies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"

2023,A Parameter Design Method for DRU-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Farm Concerning System Harmonic and Resonance Characteristics,"PEAS 2023 - 2023 IEEE 2nd International Power Electronics and Application Symposium, Conference Proceedings","The diode rectifier unit-based high voltage direct current (DRU-HVDC) integration scheme has gradually become popular for large-scale offshore wind farms (OWFs) due to its advantages in terms of low cost and lightweight. However, the traditional grid-following (GFL) control strategies of wind turbines (WTs) cannot be used since DRU lacks the grid-forming ability. Therefore, the current research mainly focuses on the grid-forming (GFM) control strategies for WTs to establish the offshore grid. However, the harmonic and resonance characteristics of the offshore grid receive relatively less attention. Accordingly, this paper proposes a parameter design method for the circuit and WTs' control parameters by considering system harmonic and resonance characteristics.

2023,Wave interactions with a cylinder surrounded by an arc-shaped breakwater,Journal of Fluids and Structures,"Inspired by the energy island used for energy storage, conversion, and transmission, this study explores the water wave interactions with a bottom-standing cylinder surrounded by an arc-shaped breakwater of negligible thickness. The arc-shaped breakwater can be either impermeable or porous. To analyze the problem, a semi-analytical matched eigenfunction expansion method is developed within the framework of linear potential flow theory. The fluid domain is divided into subdomains, with the velocity potentials in each subdomain expressed as eigenfunction expansions. Matching conditions, ensuring continuity in pressure and normal velocity, are imposed at the juncture boundary. The accuracy of the developed semi-analytical method is verified through comparison with results obtained using the numerically-based boundary element method. Extensive discussions are made on hydrodynamic responses, including wave exciting force and free surface elevations. When the breakwater is impermeable, fluid resonance occurs in the gap between the cylinder and the arc-shaped breakwater, leading to significantly large responses in both free surface elevation and hydrodynamic forces. A simple method is developed to estimate the resonant frequencies and mode shapes associated with these resonances. On the other hand, it is observed that the presence of the porous breakwater considerably reduces the free surface responses in the gap as well as the hydrodynamic loads on the cylinder. The porous breakwater effectively mitigates the occurrence of fluid resonance and offers an efficient means to dampen wave energy, providing valuable insights for wave energy dissipation and coastal engineering applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
2023,Analysis of Onshore Synthetic Inertia and Primary Control Reserve Contributions of Alternating Current-Side Meshed Offshore Grids with Voltage-Source Converter and Diode Rectifier Unit High-Voltage Direct Current Connections,Energies,"The increasing use of renewable energy sources in place of conventional generation units is leading to a reduction in onshore inertia and to the development of offshore wind park grids connected by multiple high-voltage direct current (HVDC) connections to the onshore alternating current (AC) grid. For AC-side meshed offshore grids with voltage-source converter (VSC) and diode rectifier unit (DRU) HVDC connections towards onshore grids, this study focuses on the energetic feasibility of synthetic inertia (SI) and primary control reserve (PCR) contributions triggered locally at the onshore converters of both connection types. To this end, the obstacles preventing contributions for VSC HVDC connections and the mechanisms allowing contributions for DRU HVDC connections are identified first. Based on these findings, the article proposes an enhancement of the offshore HVDC converter controls that is continuously active and allows locally triggered onshore contributions at all onshore HVDC converters of both connection types without using communication and requiring only minimal system knowledge. Additional simulations confirm that, although the enhancement is continuously active, the operational performance of the offshore HVDC converter controls for normal offshore grid operation and its robustness against offshore AC-side faults are not affected. © 2023 by the authors."

However, the presence of an excessively powered resistor group can inflict severe impacts on the system. Therefore, a novel opti⁃ mal configuration method for energy-dissipating resistors with different capacities based on progression conversion and the switching strategy are proposed. Firstly, the operational characteristics of the grouped AC energy-dissipating resistors of equal capacity are analyzed. Subsequently, multiple groups of AC energy-dissipating resistors with vary⁃ ing capacities, collectively equivalent to the total capacity of the VSC-HVDC system, are configured, and different combinations of the resistors are employed to obtain varying dissipating powers. Finally, a model of the integrated grid is constructed and validated using the PSCAD/EMTDC simulation platform.

2023,Research on the Offshore Renewable Energy Island System,"2023 3rd International Conference on Energy Engineering and Power Systems, EEPS 2023","In the case of shortage of fossil energy, the energy island integrating renewable energy such as photovoltaic and wind energy has attracted wide attention from all countries in the world. The energy island is a comprehensive energy utilization system, which can realize the collection and utilization of natural energy. It mainly includes energy utilization (power generation system), energy consumption (power consumption system) and energy balance (energy storage and micro-grid system). Building an energy island into an energy storage, conversion and transportation center can reduce the cost of land and sea energy transmission. In addition to transmitting energy to the land in the form of traditional electricity, the energy island can also be used as a base to build factories for centralized preparation, transportation and storage of hydrogen. The establishment of the energy island is conducive to further development of marine resources and marine experiments. Combine offshore ranching in the high seas with offshore wind power, take energy supply as the main body, and fishery and tourism as the auxiliary, to explore more potential value of the energy island. The offshore renewable energy island can improve the overall economic benefits, and make contributions to ensuring energy security and promoting the energy revolution. © 2023 IEEE."
2024,Protection Design of Multiterminal HVDC Grids Based on Onshore Grid Requirements,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,"This paper proposes a methodology for conceptual HVDC protection design for multiterminal HVDC grids used for the integration of offshore wind power into onshore AC systems. The applicability of HVDC protection strategies is discussed for each grid topology and evaluated in the context of different AC grid codes. Through worst-case fault impact analyses, it is shown that DC protection requirements vary significantly according to the total DC grid capacity and AC grid requirements. The protection design methodology shows that HVDC grids with a low infeed capacity or connected to AC grids with high loss of infeed limits can make use of protection strategies with fewer DC circuit breakers, compared to larger DC systems or stricter AC grid requirements.  © 2024 IEEE."
2023,Standardization of Power-from-Shore Grid Connections for Offshore Oil & Gas Production,Sustainability (Switzerland) ,"Offshore oil and gas (O&G) production is typically powered by local diesel engines or gas turbines. Power-from-shore (PFS) is an alternative that takes advantage of onshore renewable production and reduces greenhouse emissions but is limited to bespoke projects that are tailored to the characteristics of each site. This lack of repetition leads to an increase in the construction risk, delivery time, and lifecycle costs, therefore limiting their large-scale deployment. Furthermore, the absence of standardized designs is also notorious in mature applications such as offshore wind farms (OWF) despite their long-standing track record, with the negative consequences extensively covered in the literature. This research paper addresses offshore transmission standardization in two parts. First, by providing the scientific community with a review of the existing offshore O&G production and substations and secondly, by outlining a lean optioneering algorithm for the cost-optimized and technically feasible selection of the key design criteria. The exercise is centred on the main limiting component of the transmission systems—the cables. As such, it addresses their operational range and the cost to calculate the most effective configuration in terms of voltage and rated power. The end goal, based on the spread of connection proposals, is to cluster the candidates to a limited set of grid connection options, the achievement of which the model has been shown to be adequate. © 2023 by the authors."
2023,Correlations between component size green hydrogen demand and breakeven price for energy islands,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"The topic of energy islands is currently a focal point in the push for the energy transition. An ambitious project in the North Sea aims to build an offshore wind-powered electrolyser for green hydrogen production. Power-to-X (PtX) is a process of converting renewable electricity into hydrogen-based energy carriers, such as natural gas, liquid fuels and chemicals. PtH2 represents a subset of PtX, wherein hydrogen is the resultant green energy from the conversion process. Many uncertainties surround PtH2 plants, affecting the economic success of the investment and making the price of hydrogen and the levelized cost of hydrogen (LCOH) of this technology uncompetitive. Several studies have analysed PtH2 layouts to identify the hydrogen price without considering how component capacities and external inputs affect the breakeven price. Unlike previous works, this paper investigates component capacity dependencies under variables such as wind and hydrogen demand shape for dedicated/non-dedicated system layouts. To this end, the techno-economic analysis finds the breakeven price, optimising the components to reach the lowest selling price. Results show that the hydrogen price can reach 2.2 €/kg for a non-dedicated system for certain combinations of maximum demand and electrolyser capacity. Furthermore, the LCOH analysis revealed that the offshore wind electrolyser system is currently uncompetitive with hydrogen production from carbon-based technologies but is competitive with renewable technologies. The sensitivity analysis reveals the green electricity price in the non-dedicated case for which a dedicated system has a lower optimum hydrogen price. The price limit for the dedicated case is 116 €/MWh. © 2023 The Authors"
2024,Hybrid offshore wind projects. Social desirability vs. incentives to invest,Energy,"To unlock the full potential of offshore wind requires investment in a more integrated offshore grid infrastructure combining generation and interconnection between countries in so-called hybrid projects. Taking the perspective of a social planner, these projects may result in more efficient allocation of scarce resources. Alas, the distribution of this welfare gain may result in disagreement on what grid design is the most attractive, what markets should be connected and whether and when to invest. To examine these dilemmas, we apply real options theory to investments projects with different grid design and market characteristics. We compare the incentives to invest in a) only the wind farm and b) both the wind farm and the grid infrastructure, assuming the project value of the last alternative can serve as a proxy for social welfare. Solutions are derived using a simulation approach called least squares Monte Carlo method. We find: 1) Non-stationary stochastic prices and/or decreasing costs may make it socially optimal as well as commercially beneficial to postpone even profitable investments. 2) Connecting markets is socially desirable but may reduce the offshore wind investor's project value. 3) Connecting markets with different characteristics is socially desirable but reduce the offshore wind investors' project value. © 2024"
2024,The impact of offshore energy hub and hydrogen integration on the Faroe Island's energy system,Smart Energy,"This study explores the integration of offshore wind energy and hydrogen production into the Faroe Islands’ energy system to support decarbonisation efforts, particularly focusing on the maritime sector. The EnergyPLAN model is used to simulate the impact of incorporating green hydrogen, produced via electrolysis, within a closed energy system. The study evaluates different configurations of hydrogen production and their feasibility focusing on electrolyser technologies and placement options (in-turbine, platform-based, and shoreline). The hydrogen produced is intended for ammonia production, replacing 11% of the fossil fuels used in maritime transport by 2030. Results indicate that integrating hydrogen with offshore wind energy can reduce fossil fuel reliance and carbon dioxide emissions. The in-turbine electrolyser setup offers the cost-effective placement option, while the platform setup is the most expensive. Among the three electrolyser technologies evaluated (alkaline, solid oxide and proton exchange membrane), the alkaline electrolyser results in the lowest overall system cost. The findings provide insights into the potential for renewable energy systems in a small island context and contribute to a broader understanding of green hydrogen's role in energy transitions. © 2024 The Authors"

2023,"The complementarity of offshore wind and floating photovoltaics in the Belgian North Sea, an analysis up to 2100",Renewable Energy,"The combination of offshore wind with floating photovoltaics (PV) presents a major opportunity to scale up renewable energy offshore. As offshore grid development is a substantial cost driver for marine renewables, making optimal use of grid connections is most desirable. The complementarity of wind and solar resources can increase common transmission loading, thereby reducing grid costs per kWh. To fully assess the benefits of solar-wind hybridization, temporal resource complementarity must be evaluated on different timescales. In this work, the complementarity of offshore wind and solar energy resources is investigated for the Belgian North Sea using Kendall's τ. As climate change will affect the behavior of renewable energy resources, the analysis is extended up until 2100 for the climate representative concentration pathways 4.5 and 8.5. Significant solar-wind complementarity is found on monthly and weekly timescales, and to a lesser extent on daily, hourly and 10-minute timescales. Moreover, this complementarity is maintained under climate change. This study therefore identifies solar-wind hybridization as a sustainable option to reduce offshore grid costs per kWh. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd"
2023,Economic and resilient operation of hydrogen-based microgrids: An improved MPC-based optimal scheduling scheme considering security constraints of hydrogen facilities,Applied Energy,"Optimally scheduling alkaline electrolyzers (AELs) in a hydrogen-based microgrid (HBM) can greatly unleash the operational flexibility of the HBM. However, existing scheduling strategies of AELs mostly utilize a simplified AEL model, which ignores the nonlinear coupling of electric-hydrogen-thermal sectors, violating the AEL's security constraints thereby making the scheduling scheme infeasible. This paper proposes an improved model predictive control (MPC) based optimal scheduling framework which incorporates a scheduling correction algorithm into the basic MPC structure. This framework is utilized for implementing economic and resilient scheduling of an HBM under normal and emergency conditions, respectively. With the scheduling correction algorithm, this framework can be formulated into a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear programming, meanwhile guaranteeing the solutions strictly satisfy the security constraints of hydrogen facilities (i.e. AEL and hydrogen tank). Case studies are conducted based on real operating data of a Danish energy island Bornholm. The results demonstrate that the proposed scheduling scheme under normal conditions can contribute to significant comprehensive benefits from the daily operation cost saving of 68%, computational time saving of 98%, and satisfying the security constraints of hydrogen facilities, compared to previous scheduling strategies. Besides, it sharply reduces load shedding under emergency conditions by proactively allocating distributed energy sources in the HBM. © 2023 The Author(s)"

2024,Economic Analysis of Energy Transmission for Energy Island Based on Deep-Sea Offshore Wind Farms; [以深远海风电为核心的能源岛能源外送经济性分析],Zhongguo Dianli/Electric Power,"Deep-sea wind power has the advantages of rich resources, high utilization hours, and no occupation of land onshore, which is of great significance for promoting the realization of the ""double carbon"" goal. The offshore energy island with deep-sea wind power as the core can, through the integrated development model of ""offshore wind power +"", improve the comprehensive utilization rate of sea areas, enhance overall efficiency, and reduce development costs. Construction of the offshore energy island involves energy development technologies such as floating offshore wind power, energy comprehensive utilization technologies such as AWE, energy transmission technologies such as VSC-HVDC transmission and hydrogen pipeline transmission. This paper first introduces the overall composition of the energy island with the deep-sea wind power as the core, and then analyzes the transmission technologies applicable to large-scale energy transmission of the energy island. The cost of the energy island with 1000 MW floating offshore wind power through VSC-HVDC power transmission and the cost of hydrogen transmission through pipeline are calculated respectively, and the power transmission cost is compared with the cost of hydrogen transport. As the comparative analysis indicates, both the VSC-HVDC technology and the hydrogen pipeline transmission technology can be used as the energy transmission solutions for the offshore energy island. An innovative research is carried out on the economics of energy delivery for energy island. According to calculations, in 2023, 2030, and 2050, when the transmission distance is 100 km to 200 km, the economic performance of the VSC-HVDC solution is better than that of the hydrogen transmission solution. The cost and absorption capacity of the landing area need to be comprehensively considered before choosing the power transmission solution or the hydrogen transmission solution. It is predicted that in 2050, the comprehensive cost of different proportions of mixed power and hydrogen transmission for a distance of 100 km to 200 km offshore is between 0.18 yuan/kW·h and 0.27 yuan/kW·h, which is competitive compared with the cost of power transmission from new energy bases in the western and northern regions to the eastern region. © 2024 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.

2023,Real-time Risk Assessment and Regulation Strategy of New Energy Islanded Distribution Network Based on Probabilistic Prediction and Stochastic Response Surface Methodology; [基于概率预测与随机响应面法的新能源孤岛配电网实时风险评估与调控策略],Dianwang Jishu/Power System Technology,"The uncertainty of high proportion of distributed generation brings great challenges to the stable operation of the islanded distribution networks. In this paper, for the short-term prediction of source and load based on the traditional distribution model has the shortcomings of sharp peaks and heavy tails, the distribution model of source and load prediction error under multi-scenarios and different time scales is constructed by combining the bidirectional long and short-term memory (BiLSTM) neural network with the nonparametric kernel density method (KDE). On this basis, the system operates and regulates in multi-temporal operation and control process, taking into account the short-term meteorological fluctuations in the uncertainty. Then, the distflow model is relaxed by using the mixed integer second-order cone programming and the probabilistic Distflow of the system is obtained from the stochastic response surface (SRSM). Based on the stochastic response surface to improve the Sobol' method, the global sensitivity analysis model of the isolated island distribution network operation risk taking into account the source and load uncertainty is established. For this reason, a risk real-time risk assessment and regulation strategy based on BiLSTM-SRSM method is proposed. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed method is verified using a radial distribution system with the IEEE33 nodes. © 2023 Power System Technology Press. All rights reserved."

2024,Review of HVDC technologies for weak grid interconnectors,Electrical Engineering,"HVDC has experienced substantial growth in utilization globally, attributable to its superior capacity for transmitting large amounts of power relative to its HVAC counterpart and its increasingly competitive pricing. Voltage source converter technology, a variant of HVDC, is particularly well suited for transferring bulk offshore power, whether in point-to-point or multiterminal configurations. Most existing HVDC connections function as interconnections between strong AC grids or between strong and weak/islanded AC grids. However, with the expanding use of distant offshore generation, the establishment of energy islands, and the electrical interconnection of archipelagic nations such as Indonesia, the potential arises for HVDC to link two weak AC grids or even a weak and very weak AC grid. This paper provides a comprehensive review of various HVDC technologies appropriate for such connections, focusing on converters, cables, and circuit breakers. It also offers a technological and methodological assessment of HVDC reinforcement for interconnecting weak AC grids. Furthermore, the paper examines HVDC applications concerning control strategies optimized for weak grid interconnections. Finally, it presents case studies of HVDC implementations for weak grid interconnections in Indonesia. © The Author(s) 2024."
2023,Provision of optimal dispatching scenarios for regional power systems in the face of uncontrollable power shortages,Machinery and Energetics,"As of 2023, substantiation of the criteria for optimal load balancing of territorial energy islands in the face of uncontrolled power shortages due to unpredictable failure (destruction as a result of military bombardment) of the upper (trunk) level energy infrastructure is relevant. The research aims to substantiate approaches to ensuring the controlled operation of regional power systems under conditions of power shortages. The study applied the theory and methods of mathematical analysis of complex multicomponent systems in the form of mixed Boolean linear programming. A Mathematical Programming Language and modelling methods of the NEOS server based on the Gurobi solver were used to describe the modes of operation of power grids. A proportional power distribution method between load nodes of the post-emergency network configuration was used to determine the direction of electricity transit with the least losses. An algorithm and a program for solving the problem of addressing flows and power losses in multi-node regional power systems are proposed. The optimisation problem is formulated in the form of a mixed Boolean linear programming model with the criterion of minimising the power momentum, considering balance constraints and upper limits on the power between supply and load nodes. The developed transport matrix made it possible to find the optimal power distribution for emergency and post-emergency modes according to the criterion of minimum network losses. Algorithms and scenarios for the response of dispatching services were formed, considering the capacity of power grids and determining temporary power supply schemes, the configuration of which will ensure the “survivability” of energy islands. The levels of efficiency of the Boolean linear programming model associated with the connectivity of the cycles of the transport problem and the order of traversal of its vertices for test examples depending on the constraints imposed on the components of the network structure are established. The process of tracking electricity flows will allow for establishing routes connecting specific electricity supply nodes with load nodes and determining their shares in covering the energy island’s demand under conditions of power shortage. © The Author(s)."
2023,A Power Control Strategy of Offshore Wind Power Based on Unified Power Flow Controller and Topology Adjustment; [基于统一潮流控制器和拓扑调整的海上风电功率控制策略],Modern Electric Power,"In allusion to the impact of grid-connection of large-scale offshore wind power on the operation of onshore power grid and considering the new trend of interconnecting offshore wind power with onshore power transmission system to gradually form the offshore grid, an offshore wind power control strategy based on the unified power flow controller (abbr. UPFC) and the topology adjustment was proposed to control the power flow distribution in offshore power system possessing the interconnection effect, and a bi-layer joint optimal operation model, in which the control of optimal power flow of onshore power grid and the control of offshore wind power containing UPFC and topological adjustment were included, was constructed. Results of computing example show that using the proposed joint control strategy containing UPFC and topology adjustment, the power distribution of offshore wind power among all grid-connection points can be well controlled to implement the requirement of onshore power grid for the power distribution of offshore wind power among all grid-connection points and it is beneficial for friendly grid-connecting offshore wind power into onshore power grid. © 2023 Modern Electric Power.

2024,Maritime Security and the Wind: Threats and Risks to Offshore Renewable Energy Infrastructure,Ocean Yearbook Online,"Offshore wind energy production has seen a significant expansion in recent years. With technologies rapidly improving and prices dropping, it is now one of the key instruments in the green energy transition. The implications of offshore wind farm expansion for maritime security and ocean governance have, so far, received sparse attention in the literature. This article offers one of the first thorough analyses of the security of offshore wind farms and related installations, such as underwater electricity cables, energy islands, and hydrogen plants. The technical vulnerabilities of wind farm systems is reviewed and threats from terrorism, crime and State hostilities, including physical and cyber risk scenarios, are discussed. The expansion of green offshore energy production must keep pace with the changing threat landscape that follows from it. Prospective solutions for the protection of wind farms systems, including surveillance, patrols and self-protection are discussed. The current repertoire of maritime security solutions is in many ways capable of dealing with the threats and risks effectively if adjusted accordingly.

2023,Onshore And Offshore AC Grids Short-Circuit Analysis of VSC-HVDC Integrated Offshore Wind Power Plants,IET Conference Proceedings,"This paper presents a short-circuit analysis for offshore wind power plants (OWPPs), which are connected to the onshore main grid through a voltage source converter based high-voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) link. Short-circuit analysis of such hybrid AC/DC power system populated with power electronics converters has been implemented with a different approach. The studied offshore wind power plant has been modelled using a flexible formulation that includes the equivalent model of power converters. Then, by solving the established systems of equations while considering various possible current-saturation states of power converters, short-circuit equilibrium points are identified. The proposed methodology identifies all possible solutions associated with different current-saturated operation states of VSCs. Numerical case studies are included with different depths of fault in both offshore and onshore grids. The obtained results indicate that the short-circuit equilibrium point of the OWPP is significantly impacted by the VSCs operation. In addition, the paper shows that various operation points may exist depending on whether the grid-forming converter in the offshore grid reaches the current-saturation or not. © 2023 IET Conference Proceedings.

2023,High-resolution scenario building support for offshore grid development studies in a geographical information system,Energy Strategy Reviews,"On the roadmap to reach the climate targets, Europe is committed to increase offshore wind power generation substantially from today towards 2050. This raises the question, what infrastructure layout efficiently integrates offshore wind power into the transmission grid. It is commonly addressed via scenario based optimisation studies to benchmark arbitrarily defined grid topology layouts such as radial connections of wind farms to shore against multi terminal offshore hubs or hybrid interconnectors. This paper proposes a new workflow to improve the design and calibration of topology scenarios for offshore grid studies with help of an automated process in a geographical information system. Against the backdrop of the recently adopted maritime spatial plans by EU member states, a high-resolution and large scale search graph of the future offshore grid is created with a multi-criteria analysis. Complexity reduction techniques are proposed to simplify this graph for subsequent investment optimisation studies. It is found that respecting the geographic reality of the heavily managed sea space not only reduces uncertainty for future offshore projects for more accurate cost estimates and cable trajectories. The consideration of designation areas in the sea also consolidates future grid planning options into common paths of transmission which facilitates the identification of relevant scenarios for analysis. It can be shown, that the commonly chosen benchmark of an “all radial” connection of wind farms to shore is a questionable choice to which an alternative is provided. The strategic relevance of the existence of spatial planning and access to high-resolution data for an improved grid development is demonstrated at the example of Baltic and North Sea. © 2023 The Author(s)"
2023,Multi-vector optimization scheme for distributed components in energy islands; [Multivektor-Optimierungsschema für verteilte Komponenten in Energieinseln],Elektrotechnik und Informationstechnik,"Recent advancements in energy systems, such as the emergence of prosumers and sector coupling approaches, introduce additional flexibilities over multiple energy sectors, such as heating, electricity, and mobility. Due to the complexity of such distributed systems, the optimization of energy allocation is a non-trivial task, especially considering constraints and limitations introduced by distributed devices or sub-systems. Additionally, the variety of devices forces approaches to be highly situational and not universally applicable. In this paper, a two-level optimization scheme is proposed, which aims at reducing the optimization complexity of sector-coupled systems. The multi-vector optimization embedded in the two-level optimization scheme is formulated as a mixed-integer linear problem, optimizing the energy flow between domains, which are modeled as an abstraction of a sector. Distributed devices are modeled as components that represent an abstraction of devices connected to an energy domain. The optimization process is evaluated based on the data from a residential complex in Ghent, Belgium. It shows that the approach is capable of minimizing costs, CO 2 emissions, and dependency on external resources. © 2023, The Author(s)."
2024,Energy analysis and environmental impact assessment for self-sufficient non-interconnected islands: The case of Nisyros island,Journal of Cleaner Production,"The European continent is surrounded by islands, which even though geographically and socially diverse, share common energy burdens regarding heavy fossil fuels reliance. More specifically, the non-interconnected islands (NII) encounter unique challenges in the decarbonization processes, rendering them particularly vulnerable to the impacts of such transitions. Numerous studies have been conducted to address such emerging issues. However, a research gap exists, as most of the proposed RES-related grid interventions neglect actual historical data in favor of a more theoretical, but possibly misleading, approach. In addition, potential grid stability concerns arising from high levels of RES penetration remain unaddressed. To this end, the objective of the present study focuses on addressing mainly electrical grid stability and resiliency considerations (e.g. imbalances, frequency fluctuations, voltage unbalance rate, for the case of energy islands, as in the case of the NII Greek island of Nisyros). Two sustainable scenarios including novel technologies (e.g. flywheel instead of conventional BESS, a hybrid transformer, vehicle-to-grid chargers) are examined from an energetic and environmental perspective, for short- (2030) and mid-term (2050) implementation horizons, reaching electrical and energy self-sufficiency targets up to 50% and 95%, respectively. For the energy analysis, capacity-investment optimization problems, power flow simulations and specialized transient simulations were conducted, while for the environmental impact assessment a novel in-house developed tool was utilized. As a result, the proposed interventions can result in significant fossil fuel cost savings of about 88%, reduced CO2 emissions up to 38% and overall remarkable financial and environmental benefits. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that a NII can realistically abolish thermal energy to a bare minimum and enhance its self-sufficiency by harnessing local renewable energy potential, while at the same time ensuring grid stability. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd"

The purpose of the study was to substantiate the development of models for ensuring the optimal structure of electrical distribution networks under the conditions of connecting micro-networks according to the reliability criterion in conditions of limited investments. The paper uses a method for assessing the structural reliability of complex electrical systems with microgrid structures and forms a rational power distribution of such structures according to the criterion of optimising the reliability indicators of the studied electric power system. A mathematical optimisation model based on a computational system was proposed, designed to solve non-convex problems with minimising integral reliability indicators, considering financial constraints and the investment efficiency curve. Based on the research, the possibilities of optimisation using the BARON solver available on the NEOS server were examined. The results of the model’s performance are demonstrated using examples, considering the parameters of distribution system objects and their limitations on network components. An algorithm and programme for solving the problem of targeting power flows of microgrid structures in multi-node regional power systems are proposed. Algorithms and scenarios for the response of dispatching services are developed, provided that investments are limited, which will ensure the survivability of the power system as a whole. It is established that the development of rational electricity flows of microgrid structures will minimise the under-supply of electric energy by specific load nodes and determine their shares in covering the demand of the energy island in conditions of power shortage.

We assess these components considering an oil production setup that strives for reduced CO2 emissions. The problem is addressed from a probabilistic perspective. First, we utilize a quasirandom Monte Carlo approach to generate multiple scenarios regarding the uncertainties of the problem. Then, we evaluate the estimated net present value and total CO2 emissions of the system. As a highlight, our method is capable of exploiting a larger variety of data and capturing more sources of uncertainties compared to the literature. Open-source wind data is used to simulate wind power generation. Wind speed is modeled via a kernel density estimator to benefit the most from the data. The obtained results indicate that the renewable energy technologies enable outcomes with significant reduction to CO2 emissions.

This paper analyses the differences in the dynamic performance of electrolysers in a centralised and decentralised setup from a technical and economic perspective, when the target is to produce as much renewable hydrogen as possible using today's electrolyser technology. The economic effects of scaling for various wind turbines under different wind conditions are incorporated in the analysis. Differences in electrolyser efficiency, start-stop, ramping, operation range and scale are modelled, and the models are applied to a case study depicting an offshore energy hub. Using a representative wind profile of fluctuating conditions and considering identical electrolyser ramping and efficiency for the same turbine configuration, the analysis shows that the single electrolyser solution (centralised), where the electrolyser is sited at a substation, gives a better levelized cost of hydrogen than the alternative setup (decentralised) with multiple in-turbine electrolysers. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
2023,Power Routing Strategy for an Offshore-Onshore Bipolar VSC-HVDC Interconnector,"2023 IEEE Belgrade PowerTech, PowerTech 2023","Distantly-located offshore energy hubs need to be connected to the shore via High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) links to allow for an efficient bulk power exchange. A bipolar configuration of the HVDC link is suitable for a point-to-point connection, as it provides redundancy, and, therefore, a larger reliability, e.g. half of the rated transfer capacity can still be transferred via one of the poles in case of a fault occurring on the other pole. Nevertheless, a control strategy of the converters that can effectively enable a situation-dependent power routing between the two poles constitutes a research challenge. In this paper, two control strategies are proposed for the offshore Modular Multi-level Converters (MMCs) of a bipolar HVDC link connecting a 2 GW offshore hub to the shore. The strategies, based on DC current and DC voltage measurements, respectively, enable to track and adjust the amount of power flowing through each pole of the link. Real-time digital simulations show that both strategies can effectively route the power exchanges through the bipolar HVDC link, e.g. operation under balanced or unbalanced conditions. The strategy based on DC current seems more suitable to manage the dynamic performance of the HVDC link. © 2023 IEEE."
2024,Assessing fluctuating wind to hydrogen production via long-term testing of solid oxide electrolysis stacks,Applied Energy,"The Danish government plans two energy islands to collect offshore wind power for power distribution and green fuel production. Wind power is often criticized for lacking stability, which challenges downstream fuel synthesis processes. Solid oxide electrolysis cells (SOEC) are promising for green hydrogen production on a commercial scale, but the impact of fluctuating power on SOEC remains uncertain. This paper explores the feasibility of a Wind-SOEC coupled system by conducting a 2104-h durability test with the state-of-the-art Topsoe TSP-1 stack. Three periods of steady operation and two periods of dynamic operation were conducted. Wind power fluctuation was simulated during the dynamic period, and two control strategies were used to handle it. The constant flow (CF) and constant conversion (CC) strategies maintain the feedstock flow rate and conversion ratio of steam-to‑hydrogen, respectively. Compared to steady operation, the stack shows no signs of additional degradation in dynamic operation. Thus, the TSP-1 stack has been proven robust and flexible enough to handle fluctuating wind power supplies under both operation strategies. Further, stack performance during dynamic periods was compared and analyzed by removing degradation effects. Accordingly, SOEC stacks with CC control will consume less external heat than CF to maintain a heat balance. Nevertheless, SOEC systems with CF and CC control strategies may have different efficiency or hydrogen production costs. Tech-economic analyses will be needed to investigate control strategies at the system level. © 2024 The Authors"
2024,Comparative Analysis of Grid-forming Controls Impact on Stability of Energy Islands,"2024 IEEE 10th International Power Electronics and Motion Control Conference, IPEMC 2024 ECCE Asia","Energy Island (EI) is proposed as a solution to increase the penetration of offshore wind energy. Being a fully converter-based system, new challenges arise regarding their stable operation. This paper investigates the effects of the two most common grid-forming (GFM) controls on the stability of such a system. To ensure the stable operation of the EI, a minimum required number of converters to operate in GFM control mode is determined. Simulations are performed in MATLAB/Simulink using a test system replicating an EI. The results show the stability of EI varies depending on the specific GFM control (whether a cascaded current control loop is used or not). © 2024 IEEE."
2024,Fault Handling Capabilities of Grid-Forming Wind Turbines in Offshore Wind Farms Connected with MMC HVDC System,IEEE Access,"Offshore wind power generation equipped with conventional grid following controls challenges the power system stability by reducing the inertia of the grid and weakening the AC offshore grid. To overcome this vulnerability a promising solution could be equipping the wind turbines with grid-forming (GFM) control schemes. Many methodologies have been presented in the literature for GFM inverters. In spite of this, their applications for WTGs have not been thoroughly explored. This paper presents the study of fault handling capability of wind turbines with several grid-forming control strategies. In this context, four different control schemes i.e. Visynch, P/f droop, Q/f droop and conventional grid following control are considered. The performance of these control strategies is assessed and compared during a three-phase symmetrical fault on the point of common coupling of an offshore wind farm. A case study which consists of two wind turbines connected to the main converter of an offshore substation equipped with grid-forming control is also considered. The results indicate that, during faults, each of the four control strategies (Visynch, P/f droop, Q/f droop, and Gfol) effectively limits the current and restores normal operation. A significant advantage of Q/F droop control is its reduced sensitivity to variations in system and fault parameters, adjustable frequency response, and independence from existing Phase-Locked Loops (PLLs). On the other hand, the P/f droop control provides greater voltage support during faults due to its voltage controllers. However, post-fault oscillations result from the stiff voltage controller. Visynch control, on the other hand, shows a lower margin of stability. The advantages and weaknesses of each control scheme is revealed using the simulation results.  © 2013 IEEE."
2023,Powering Europe’s Energy Transition: Financial Viability of a Full-Scale Meshed HVDC Grid and Hybrid Offshore Assets in the North Sea,IEEE PES Innovative Smart Grid Technologies Conference Europe,"An HVDC grid in the North Sea is crucial for Europe’s energy transition. High investment costs, lack of operational experience, and regulatory hurdles are the major roadblocks to its realization. This paper demonstrates the financial viability of a full-scale meshed HVDC grid in the North Sea, considering multiple market scenarios and incorporating Offshore Wind Power Plants (OWPP). A method based on the day-ahead market price is adopted to calculate the benefits of inter-zonal links. A stochastic optimization approach is used to determine the lowest-cost grid topology under consideration of different scenarios. Further, the benefits of a strategy considering both OWPP development and HVDC grid expansion in unison, forming so-called Hybrid Offshore Assets (HOAs), is investigated. A plausible test case in the North Sea is investigated for the financial viability of a demonstration grid in the region. It is optimized for different interconnectors and terminal converter capacities. It is found that the demo grid does not incur loss even for 5% interest rate on the capital while making a high profit for a lower interest rate. It is further demonstrated that a planning approach considering HOAs may significantly reduce the cost of developing offshore wind resources in the North Sea while increasing the interconnection of North Sea energy markets. © 2023 IEEE Computer Society.

2023,Powering Europe with North Sea offshore wind: The impact of hydrogen investments on grid infrastructure and power prices,Energy,"Hydrogen will be a central cross-sectoral energy carrier in the decarbonization of the European energy system. This paper investigates how a large-scale deployment of green hydrogen production affects the investments in transmission and generation towards 2060, analyzes the North Sea area with the main offshore wind projects, and assesses the development of an offshore energy hub. Results indicate that the hydrogen deployment has a tremendous impact on the grid development in Europe and in the North Sea. Findings indicate that total power generation capacity increases around 50%. The offshore energy hub acts mainly as a power transmission asset, leads to a reduction in total generation capacity, and is central to unlock the offshore wind potential in the North Sea. The effect of hydrogen deployment on power prices is multifaceted. In regions where power prices have typically been lower than elsewhere in Europe, it is observed that hydrogen increases the power price considerably. However, as hydrogen flexibility relieves stress in high-demand periods for the grid, power prices decrease in average for some countries. This suggests that while the deployment of green hydrogen will lead to a significant increase in power demand, power prices will not necessarily experience a large increase. © 2022 The Author(s)"

2024,Spatial Optimization for Energy Island Location and Cable Routing Considering Offshore Zoning,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"The energy hub concept presents a compelling opportunity to channel electricity from offshore wind farms to the grid, facilitating cross-border energy trading and conversion. However, one of the main challenges lies in the strategic identification of a suitable energy island location and the establishment of an interconnected cable routing path. Part of the complexity arises from the need to navigate offshore zoning regulations and accommodate various spatial uses within the offshore area. This paper exhibits a case study to explore the spatial optimization for a potential offshore energy hub in the North Sea. It aims at finding out an optimal spatial configuration of the offshore energy hub, such that the island location and the associated cable routing do not infringe upon keep-out zones while strategically positioning the hub closer to high-capacity wind farms. To achieve this goal, detailed geographical data incorporating offshore zoning information is leveraged for spatial optimization. The Dijkstra's algorithm is then applied to identify the optimal island location and cable routing path. The effectiveness of this spatial optimization methodology is demonstrated through a case study involving offshore wind farm sites in the North Sea. Given the real geographical data, simulation results underscore the efficacy of the Dijkstra's algorithm in determining the optimal energy hub layout. In particular, an optimal spatial design is achieved, based on cable lengths, asset capacities, offshore zoning and island/platform location for a potential offshore energy hub in the North Sea while ensuring compliance with keep-out zoning regulations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
2023,Offshore Wind Integration in the North Sea: The Benefits of an Offshore Grid and Floating Wind,"International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM","Wind energy has become increasingly important for meeting Europe's energy needs. While onshore wind expansion faces public acceptance problems, for offshore wind the European Commission has introduced ambitious goals to increase capacity from 15 GW to 300 GW in 2050. Incorporating more offshore wind electricity into the power grid may offer a more widely accepted way to satisfy Europe's energy demand. In particular, the North Sea region has large potential for offshore wind generation. However, to fully exploit the wind potential in the North Sea, the grid integration of offshore wind and floating wind turbines are vital, especially when onshore wind capacity and onshore grid expansion are constrained. For the grid integration, a meshed offshore grid can offer a viable alternative to the standard direct connection of offshore wind parks to the nearest point on land combined with point-to-point HVDC connections. In this paper we investigate the benefits of having a meshed offshore grid in the North Sea and considering floating wind besides fixed-bottom wind installations. In our analysis, we look at eight different scenarios, where onshore wind potentials and onshore line expansion are limited, to explore the effects of low public acceptance. Our results demonstrate that the presence of an offshore grid can reduce total system costs by up to 2.6 bnC/a. In the scenarios with an offshore meshed grid ∼8% more offshore wind capacities are built compared to the scenarios without a meshed grid. Furthermore, the analysis shows that if onshore wind potentials are restricted, floating wind turbines play a key role and compensate for lacking onshore wind capacities.  © 2023 IEEE."
2024,POWER COUPLING CHARACTERISTICS ANALYSIS OF GRID-FORMING INVERTER CONNECTED WITH DIODE RECTIFIER-BASED HVDC SYSTEM,IET Conference Proceedings,"The diode rectifier (DR) based high voltage direct current (DR-HVDC) system has great potential for application in offshore wind energy transmission due to its relatively low cost and high reliability. To support the AC-side voltage of DR and regulate the transmission power, the grid forming control is widely equipped in the grid-side inverter of the offshore wind turbine (WT). However, the uncontrollable commutation dynamics of the DR introduce huge coupling effects between the active and reactive power at DR-HVDC, thus worsening the power regulation dynamics of offshore grid-forming inverters (GFI). This paper first proposes a small-signal model of the DR-HVDC system to intuitively and analytically characterize its power coupling effect. By combining the derived small-signal model of decoupling P/V-Q/f power-controlled GFI, the power coupling characteristics of the GFI-DR-HVDC system are quantitatively studied based on the relative gain array (RGA) theory. It is revealed that the increase of the proportional coefficient in the active power controller and the droop coefficient in the reactive power controller can both reduce the power coupling degree, but increasing the active power controller integral coefficient makes the power coupling degree rise. The simulation results validate the theoretical analysis. © The Institution of Engineering & Technology 2024."

In this paper, a mathematical impedance model of MMC with different frequency-coupling characteristics is developed with consideration of the inner dynamic process of the primary main circuit equipment, control link delay, sequence component separation link, inner and outer loop control links. The mathematical model is simplified to determine the high-frequency oscillation mechanism caused by the integration of islanded renewable energy station into the MMC-HVDC system, which is that the control link delay, inner loop current feedback and voltage feedforward link format the high-frequency negative damping of the MMC-HVDC system. The key factors affecting the high-frequency impedance characteristics of the MMC are obtained. Based on the key factors, the suppression schemes of high-frequency oscillation caused by the integration of islanded renewable energy station into MMC-HVDC system are also suggested. The corresponding solutions have been verified in the PSCAD model and the high-frequency oscillation problem in the engineering sites of Zhangbei and Rudong renewable energy transmission projects of China through the MMC-HVDC system has been solved. © 2023 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press.

2023,Transient Stability Enhancement Strategy for Islanded Microgrids Based on Energy Storage–Virtual Synchronous Machine Control,Energies,"In a high percentage of new energy-islanded microgrids, the overall inertia of the system gradually decreases, and the transient stability requirements of the microgrid frequency and voltage become more and more demanding under low-inertia conditions. To improve the transient stability of low-inertia islanded microgrid frequencies and voltages, this paper proposes a transient stability enhancement strategy for islanded microgrids based on energy storage system (ESS)–virtual synchronous generator (VSG) control. Model predictive control (MPC) is added within the active control loop of the VSG to achieve dynamic correction of the active power reference value of the VSG; PI control link is added within the reactive control loop to achieve a fast dynamic response of the reactive power command value. The ESS achieves fast and accurate regulation of frequency and voltage according to the power reference value of the VSG active control loop and the power command value of the reactive control loop simultaneously. Considering the need to ensure the ability of VSG to operate stably during transients, a comprehensive current-limiting technique combining virtual impedance and phase limiting is used to limit the fault current of VSG and maintain its synchronization and stability. Finally, the simulation results verify the strategy’s effectiveness and the superiority of the transient stability enhancement effect. © 2023 by the authors."
2023,Meteorological hazard risk assessment of offshore wind power grids based on CVAR method,Procedia Computer Science,"Wind energy is a clean, renewable and green energy. Compared to land-based wind power, offshore wind power does not occupy land resources. Meanwhile offshore wind resources is much richer and its wind direction is more stable. Meteorological hazards have a major impact on offshore wind facilities. Typhoons, lightning, rainstorms and other meteorological hazards that occur during operation can not only cause fatal damage to offshore wind facilities, but often also trigger a chain reaction of marine hazards, making them more difficult to maintain. In this paper, we analyze the impact of various types of meteorological hazards on offshore wind facilities with examples and select the most important ones. A comprehensive risk assessment model CVAR for offshore wind projects is developed in combination with other types of risk elements to predict the damaging of offshore wind facilities so that managers can respond in a timely manner. In addition, A nonlinear stepwise regression (NLSR) approach is then used to forecast the meteorological elements in offshore grid facilities. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.. All rights reserved."

2024,Electrolysis as a flexibility resource on energy islands: The case of the North Sea,Energy Policy,"Energy islands are meant to facilitate offshore sector integration by combining offshore wind energy with power-to-x technologies and storage. In this study, we investigate the operation of electrolysers on energy islands, assess their potential contribution to flexibility provision, and analyse different market integration strategies of the islands. For this purpose, a two-stage stochastic optimisation model is developed to determine the cost-efficient dispatch for an integrated day-ahead and balancing electricity market. For the market integration of the energy island, we align our approach to the current debate and compare the case of a single offshore bidding zone to a case where the energy island is integrated into a home market zone. We find that electrolysers on energy islands will run at low capacity factors and provide flexibility in 29–36% of their run time. In addition, offshore electrolysers produce more hydrogen when they are allocated to an offshore bidding zone, and thus earn higher profits. We conclude that combining offshore wind with electrolysers on an energy island relies on additional economic incentives if their main role is envisioned to be the delivery of balancing flexibility. © 2023 The Author(s)"

2024,"Risks, strategies, and benefits of offshore energy hubs: A literature-based survey",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"Offshore Energy Hubs, also called Energy Islands, are intensively discussed to become a key element in the process of decarbonising the energy sector. The vision of implementing Offshore Energy Hubs in the context of exploiting offshore wind potentials in Northern Europe is led by industry and has quickly taken up a spot in the political discussion on national and European level. This research develops a survey scheme inspired by multi-criteria analysis to assess the main drivers in the development of Offshore Energy Hubs. We propose a definition, present the scheme, and conduct a survey based on the scheme for the case of the North Sea offshore energy infrastructure. Applying the suggested survey method to the context of the North Sea, we identify five trade-offs to be considered. The significance of the environmental benefits is strongly linked to the choice of materials and designs; changes to current assumptions may flip the system's benefits and turn the project into a series of sunk investments; coordinated and integrated planning is key to boosting the project's efficiency; offshore energy infrastructure presents a technological solution to energy system decarbonisation and needs to touch base with societal desires and behavioural solutions; and Offshore Energy Hubs are currently standalone solutions with no competitors, which makes their benefits impossible to compare. © 2024 The Authors"

2022,State Space Modeling of an Offshore Wind Power Plant With an MMC-HVDC Connection for an Eigenvalue-Based Stability Analysis,IEEE Access,"Large offshore wind power plants (OWPPs) installed far from the coastline are emerging to benefit from the strong and steady wind resources available at these locations. The high-voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission system based on the modular multilevel converter (MMC) is the most appropriate solution to transmit the produced energy to the onshore grid, in a way that a complex power-electronic-based electrical system is formed at the OWPP. Undesired interactions can occur between the MMC-based HVDC station, the several wind-turbine (WT) converters, and the passive elements of the offshore grid. To guarantee a safe and reliable operation of the OWPP, a small-signal analysis must be performed in advance to predict possible unstable situations and their root causes, in a way as to take corrective measures to avoid them. In this paper, a state-space model of an OWPP is developed adopting a recently proposed model in multiple dq frames of the MMC, which considers the internal dynamics of the converter. With the developed model, an eigenvalue-based stability assessment is carried out, where participation factors are calculated to identify the main contributors to the unstable modes that appear as a consequence of undesired low-frequency interactions at the offshore grid. As far as the authors know, an eigenvalue-based stability assessment of an OWPP with an MMC-HVDC connection is a topic rarely or never explored in the literature before since a detailed time-invariant state-space model of the MMC was not available until recently. Thus, the eigenvalue-based stability study is the main contribution of this paper. The developed model can easily be extended to more complex OWPPs with different configurations in future works. Another contribution of this paper is the proposal of an adaptation to the MMC's grid-following state-space model so that the converter's dynamics in grid-forming mode can be represented. Finally, various studies are presented to prove that the adopted MMC's approximated model is accurate enough for small-signal stability analyses. © 2013 IEEE."

2022,Distributed Generation Power Systems in Wastewater Management †,Energies,"The article concerns the energy security of a wastewater treatment process caused by unforeseen situations related to the risk of electrical power outages. In this case, renewable energy sources based on distributed generation power systems can solve this problem in each wastewater treatment plant. The article highlights e related challenges and proposes the direction of solutions in this regard based on Czech conditions. The first part of the paper deals with the consequences of long-term outage of wastewater treatment plants on the population and the environment. There are several solutions presented for blackout conditions, and model calculations are made based on data from a Czech wastewater treatment plant. Diesel engine-generators, biogas as a cogeneration source of heat and electricity, solar panels with storage systems and combined biogas and solar systems were considered as approaches to provide energy autonomy during a blackout in a wastewater treatment plant. Special attention was paid to a combination of CHP units with solar panels and batteries. The results were evaluated for three different locations for this combination. It was concluded that biogas combustion in the CHP unit was the most profitable option, allowing the production of electricity independently of the grid for its own consumption and possibly for other operations. The last part of the paper deals with the transition to island operation, which must occur during a blackout. This transition is more difficult for both solar panels and cogeneration units if they were to supply electricity to the grid before a blackout. The transition to energy island operation could be ensured by frequency relay and processor devices to control the circuit breaker. Then, to maintain island operation, it would be necessary to have an automatic load shedding/application system. © 2022 by the authors."

The proposed design of the public call projected excellent performance in respect to RES penetration with 82.8%. This study proposed Scenario 2 that was significantly less expensive than the public call, with an initial investment of €1.45M vs €3.00M of the public call. In addition, Scenario 2 had an LCOE of 0.149 €/kWh in comparison to the LCOE of 0.271 €/kWh for Scenario 1 and the sensitivity analysis showed that the LCOE of Scenario 2 has very small fluctuations.

2022,Zero-Inertia Offshore Grids: N-1 Security and Active Power Sharing,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,"With Denmark dedicated to maintaining its leading position in the integration of massive shares of wind energy, the construction of new offshore energy islands has been recently approved by the Danish government. These new islands will be zero-inertia systems, meaning that no synchronous generation will be installed in the island and that power imbalances will be shared only among converters. To this end, this paper proposes a methodology to calculate and update the frequency droops gains of the offshore converters in compliance with the N-1 security criterion in case of converter outage. The frequency droop gains are calculated solving an optimization problem which takes into consideration the power limitations of the converters as well as the stability of the system. As a consequence, the proposed controller ensures safe operation of off-shore systems in the event of any power imbalance and allows for greater loadability at pre-fault state, as confirmed by the simulation results.  © 1969-2012 IEEE."

2022,DESIGN ALGORITHM OF HARMONIC FILTERS IN A MESHED TRANSMISSION GRID WITH DISTRIBUTED HARMONIC EMISSION SOURCES – EASTERN DANISH TRANSMISSION GRID CASE STUDY,IET Conference Proceedings,"The transmission grid in Denmark undergoes tremendous reinforcement and development due to massive integration of renewables and PtX, stronger market coupling with foreign grids and connection of the Energy Islands. The political goal is that new transmission lines shall, to the most technically feasible extent, be established as underground cables (UGC) and part of overhead lines (OHL) substituted with UGC. The Danish experience has shown that especially 400 kV UGC may cause resonance conditions, which coincide with harmonic orders of the harmonic distortion and increase the harmonic voltage distortion. Establishment of harmonic filters with the right properties, ratings and locations in the transmission grid is among mitigation solutions of excessive harmonic distortion. In the meshed transmission grid, a new harmonic filter may, on the one hand, dampen a specific harmonic order in the given substation, but, on the other hand, become inefficient or even increase harmonic distortion in other substations. Therefore, the harmonic filter design for the meshed transmission grid is a challenging task. This presentation will explain the algorithm developed by Energinet, Transmission System Operator of Denmark, for automated design of harmonic filters in the meshed transmission grids by simulations. The algorithm will be demonstrated using a validated simulation model of the Eastern Danish 400 kV transmission grid for harmonic assessment as a case study. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings.

The operation mode, configuration of each mode, and economy of this kind of system are worth studying. A configuration optimization model of the offshore wind-hydrogen system is established. Different operation modes of the system, including single power supply mode, dual power supply mode, multi-energy islanded mode, and multi-energy grid-connected mode, are compared and analyzed. Effects of various sensitive factors on the capacity configuration and economy are discussed. The simulation results show that the realization of supplying offshore loads with full clean energy needs to be at the expense of economic reduction, and the hydrogen price and the electrolyzer price have the greatest influence on the configuration and income of the system. © 2022 Automation of Electric Power Systems Press."
2021,Model Predictive Control based Optimal Dispatch of Wind and Hydrogen Hybrid Systems,"Proceedings - 2021 International Conference on Advanced Technology of Electrical Engineering and Energy, ATEEE 2021","To realize decarbonization, green hydrogen has been boosted in Denmark with the support of power to hydrogen (P2H) technology by taking advantage of enormous wind energy. The work efficiency of P2H technology, converting electricity from renewable energy into green hydrogen by water electrolysis can be improved by recycling its waste heat, which can be called power to hydrogen and heat (P2HH). In this paper, P2HH has been applied with a large-scale alkaline electrolyser, so that it works as a prosumer consuming electricity, and producing hydrogen and heat simultaneously. The mathematical model of the wind and hydrogen hybrid system with P2HH technology has been built and the economic performance of the hybrid system connected to the power grid has been investigated by applying an economic model predictive control (EMPC) strategy for its optimal dispatch. By using real-life historical data from the Bornholm energy island in Denmark, the simulation results show that the EMPC controller is capable of robustness to achieve optimal electricity consumption, energy cost savings, and the best economic benefits in terms of various system configurations, weights for hydrogen price, constraints on its recycled heat and working temperature. Among these configurations, without constraints on the recycled heat and weights for hydrogen price, the electrolyser working in the 60-90 °C can achieve the most profits in the study case.  © 2021 IEEE."
2021,Capacity planning method of energy storage system for micro integrated energy system in environmental friendly islands; [面向绿色海岛微型综合能源系统的储能系统容量规划方法],Dianli Zidonghua Shebei/Electric Power Automation Equipment,"The development of micro integrated energy systems and rational allocation of energy storage devices are important means to achieve the goal of substantially increasing the proportion of clean energy, increasing the utilization efficiency of comprehensive energy and building a clean energy island. Therefore, based on the comparison and analysis of the operation characteristics of different types of energy storage technologies, the application advantages of NSF-CAES(Non-Supplementary Fired Compressed Air Energy Sto-rage) in the integrated energy system are fully considered. Taking NSF-CAES technology as a representative, the capacity planning method of energy storage system for micro integrated energy system is studied. Firstly, considering the combined heat and power storage/generation characteristics of NSF-CAES, the operation constraint set of NSF-CAES system is constructed for optimal planning problem. On this basis, the capacity planning method of NSF-CAES system is proposed for the micro integrated energy system with the objective of maximizing the net benefit brought by NSF-CAES. Then, by means of equivalent linear transformation, the established planning model is transformed into the mixed integer linear programming model which can be solved easily. Finally, the validity of the established model is verified by a simulation example. Simu-lative results show that although the total investment cost of NSF-CAES station is relatively high, installing NSF-CAES system can bring significant economic benefits to the micro integrated energy system due to its merit of long lifetime and its unique capability of combined heat and power storage/generation. © 2021, Electric Power Automation Equipment Press.

2022,Integration of Pump-Storage Batteries in Offshore Wind Farms: Evaluation of Effects on Power Exchange,"Proceedings of the 11th International Conference on Innovative Smart Grid Technologies - Asia, ISGT-Asia 2022","While having a significant contribution to the total installed capacity, rapid development of offshore wind farms (OWFs) pose technical challenges for supply-demand balancing and onshore grid capacity.

2022,Economic model predictive control for multi-energy system considering hydrogen-thermal-electric dynamics and waste heat recovery of MW-level alkaline electrolyzer,Energy Conversion and Management,"A large-scale alkaline electrolyzer (AE), can convert renewable electricity into green hydrogen and recoverable heat, and consequently unlock great flexibility to accommodate renewable power variability. This paper proposes an economic model predictive control (EMPC) based daily optimal operation strategy for a multi-energy system (MES) which unleashes the cross-sectoral operational flexibility of AE. A dynamic power-to-hydrogen&heat (P2H2) model for AE is presented, considering heat recovery and efficiency variation under different loading conditions. Instead of incorporating the nonlinear P2H2 model into the operating optimization model of MES, this paper has developed a more computationally efficient algorithm that uses the P2H2 model for post-evaluation of optimal scheduling derived from a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based EMPC. Comparative cases based on real data of a Danish energy island Bornholm, demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness of the proposed method and the potential value of AE's operational flexibility in the MESs. The results reveal that the proposed method contributes to additional operation cost savings of 59% and 38% compared to a traditional rule-based strategy and an economic strategy without P2H2 model. © 2022 The Author(s)"
2022,Transition Potential of Local Energy Communities,Technologies for Integrated Energy Systems and Networks,"In this chapter, the authors address the role of local energy communities (LEC) in the transition toward a low- or even carbon-neutral energy system. LECs are contextualized in the broader framework of the energy revolution started after Paris Agreements in December 2015 that led to the definition of 17 “sustainable development goals (SDGs)” by United Nations (UN) and to the establishment of the Clean Energy Package by European Commission in 2019. At global level, Energy Communities play a pivotal role to achieve United Nations SDG 7 (“Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”) and 11 (“Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable”), the former more focused on rural communities and the latter more focused on urban context. This is even more true if thinking that reducing energy poverty, by bringing clean and affordable energy in rural areas through hybrid energy systems, is a fundamental strategy to develop rural contexts while also reducing migration toward urban areas and megacities. At European level, Energy Communities have a fundamental role in a consumer-centered energy system in which consumers and prosumers are fully engaged and play an active role both in single and in aggregated forms also with new forms of citizen participation (citizen energy communities). Indeed, LECs provide the right framework for increasing awareness, engagement, and empowerment of citizens in the energy sector. Moreover, LECs can be considered as multi-energy environments in which different energy systems and vectors can be integrated in order to optimally exploit the synergies among energy and non-energy networks (e.g. water distribution network and desalination systems). This is even more true when dealing with “geographical” or “energy” islands in which local energy communities are well identified by geographical or network boundaries. In the second part of the chapter, the authors will provide a vision on how the technologies and systems presented in this book, implemented in local multi-energy communities, can support the achievement of goal of a transition toward carbon-neutral energy systems. Finally, the authors present a vision for the future role of LECs in the energy transition, starting from the experience of European Green Deal. © 2022 WILEY-VCH GmbH, Boschstr. 12, 69469 Weinheim, Germany.

2022,Development of the Risks from the design of the E-LAND solution to the implementation,"Proceedings of the 32nd European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2022 - Understanding and Managing Risk and Reliability for a Sustainable Future","The E-LAND project is developing a set of tools to allow renewable energy actors to minimize their energy production and consumption costs. The solution computes an optimal scheduler based on user’s data (e.g., consumption and production capacities or infrastructures) and external parameters (as forecast or market price). Yet the introduction of this new solution in existing infrastructures forces to adopt new protocols that also introduce new risks with the new functionalities. With the E-LAND solution, the future users must adapt their production from locally stored data to non-local data. The project which started in 2019 now has reached the implementation phase of the tools at the different pilot sites. This paper compares how risks were understood at the beginning of the project, how the risks have developed through the project and how the pilot sites handle their ownership of the risks. This includes the difficulties of physical interaction with the partners and third parties’ operators through the pandemic. The paper also evaluates the risk process so far: if the risks foreseen for the pilot sites were accurate, what preparation was necessary to understand and handle the risk, and how were the risks communicated through the project? As risk manager, our focus on risk awareness and risk communication received good feedbacks from the partners. On the other hand, not foreseen risks arise along the project. © 2022 ESREL2022 Organizers. Published by Research Publishing, Singapore."
2022,An adaptive multiagent control system for autonomous economic operation and resilience assurance in a hybrid-energy islanded microgrid,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,"Multi-agent control is widely recognized as an effective management system for modern microgrids. This paper proposes a hierarchical distributed multi-agent control system for an islanded microgrid with hybrid-energy resources and a battery-storage bank. The dispatchable dispersed generators are to be online-controlled to stabilize the islanded microgrid and minimize operation cost. A non-dispatchable agent is assigned to each bus with a non-dispatchable generator or a load. A dispatchable agent is assigned to each bus with a dispatchable generator. The control scheme is organized into three layers. The primary control layer comprises only the agent which runs the very fast local voltage/frequency droop-control of the battery-storage bank. It achieves a quasi-instantaneous power balance under any disturbance to maintain the frequency and voltage stability of the microgrid. The secondary control layer is formed by fast control algorithms on the dispatchable agents working at 2 ms time step. It is responsible for regulating the islanded microgrid frequency and voltage at minimum participation time of the battery-storage bank. The tertiary control layer is made by relatively slow control algorithms on the dispatchable agents working at a time step of 200 ms. It copes with the economic operation of the microgrid. Each agent behaves autonomously and shares data with others via communication links. The architecture and control algorithms of each layer are presented. Besides, the coordination protocol between different layers is described. The scheme is implemented by a parallel Matlab-Jade computing setup. Results of a case study islanded microgrid are analysed and compared to literature. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
2022,The Value of Sector Coupling for the Development of Offshore Power Grids,Energies,"Offshore grids can play key roles in the transition of energy systems toward sustainability. Although they require extensive infrastructure investments, they allow for the exploitation of additional resources and may be important in providing for part of the increasing electricity demands driven by sector coupling. This paper quantifies the socioeconomic value of offshore grids and identifies their major drivers, performing energy system optimization in a model application of the northern–central European energy system and the North Sea offshore grid towards 2050. The increasing wake loss with the sizes of hub-connected wind farms is integrated in the modeling. We find that without sector coupling no offshore grid may develop, and that the higher the level of sector coupling, the higher the value of offshore grids. Therefore, it can be strongly stated that offshore grid infrastructure development should not be discussed as a separate political topic, but seen in connection to sector coupling. © 2022 by the authors.

2022,Feasibility evaluation of Stand-Alone energy solutions in Energy-Poor Islands using sustainable hydrogen production,International Journal of Energy Research,"The current research presents a techno-economic feasibility analysis of the stand-alone hydrogen-based configurations to electrify three poor-energy islands located to the east of Canada (Pelee, Wolfe, and Saint Pierre Islands). The proposed procedure explores the possibility of various hybrid energy systems, including wind turbine, electrolyzer, hydrogen tank, diesel generator, fuel cell, supercapacitor, and converter, considering two main scenarios; Scenario I: with diesel and Scenario II: without diesel. The real-time field data of wind speed, outside air temperature, load demand, and diesel price during 8760 hr in a year have been used. The optimization results favored scenario I in Saint Pierre Island, which utilizes 133 wind turbines, 600 kg hydrogen tanks, 600 kW electrolyzer, 200 kW diesel generator, 100 kW fuel cell, 363 701 supercapacitor units, and 252 kW converter. This combination has $0.68 M (16%) and $2 M (36%) lower the net present cost (NPC), as well as $0.059/kWh (19%) and $0.175/kWh (36%) lower the levelized cost of electricity than scenario I in Pelee Island and Wolfe Island, respectively. Among solutions from scenario I, the cleanest case is found in Saint Pierre Island by having four- and three-times lower emissions than options in Wolfe Island and Pelee Island, respectively. The economic indicators are highly dependent on the capital cost fluctuations of supercapacitor and wind turbines than other components. Sensitivity analysis highlighted that the lowest values of the NPC are seen under the inflation rate of 2% within 10 to 16 m/s wind speed and 14% inflation rate within 12 to 15 m/s wind speed. The effects of timestep fluctuation revealed that optimizing solutions within samples in intervals greater than 30 min is recommended. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons Ltd."
2021,Smart energy community: A systematic review with metanalysis,Energy Strategy Reviews,"Smart energy community, energy community or many other variants of this name has been researched since the 70s but has gained more prominence in the last decade. In order to better understand the concept of energy community and analyze the main research trends in this subject, it was performed a systematic literature review using six databases and a set of carefully chosen keywords obtained after preliminary analysis of energy community concept and its many variations. As a result, the literature review shows that there are many concepts and overlapping of definitions, which creates confusion between researches and readers and the need to standardize the terminology used. Results also highlight the need to analyze the synergistic improvement in multi-purpose energy communities and to research energy islands as smart communities in a way to simulate, create and implement solutions that can be adapt in land communities. © 2021 The Authors"
2021,Addressing Risks and challenges for the pilot sites installing the E-LAND solution,"Proceedings of the 31st European Safety and Reliability Conference, ESREL 2021","New technology and access to renewable energy sources enable production of electricity by new actors on the energy markets. One such actor is the energy islands, isolated communities that produce and consume a part or all their energy needs. The E-LAND project is developing a toolbox that use consumers data and external data (weather, energy prices) to deliver an optimal energy schedule, that minimizes the cost of energy production and consumption. The E-LAND solution should support the energy islands to emerge on the energy market using a new technology, with new functionalities, and new ways of thinking performing both their operational and business processes: these changes come with new risks. This paper presents how risks are understood and managed, firstly by the project with regards to the pilot sites, that constitutes a set of first users chosen to represent different industries and energy technologies; and secondly, by the pilot sites themselves. The analysis identified risks with a top-down approach, based on different use cases, designed for each pilot sites.

2022,Benefits of an integrated power and hydrogen offshore grid in a net-zero North Sea energy system,Advances in Applied Energy,"The North Sea Offshore Grid concept has been envisioned as a promising alternative to: 1) ease the integration of offshore wind and onshore energy systems, and 2) increase the cross-border capacity between the North Sea region countries at low cost. In this paper we explore the techno-economic benefits of the North Sea Offshore Grid using two case studies: a power-based offshore grid, where only investments in power assets are allowed (i.e. offshore wind, HVDC/HVAC interconnectors); and a power-and-hydrogen offshore grid, where investments in offshore hydrogen assets are also permitted (i.e. offshore electrolysers, new hydrogen pipelines and retrofitted natural gas pipelines). In this paper we present a novel methodology, in which extensive offshore spatial data is analysed to define meaningful regions via data clustering. These regions are incorporated to the Integrated Energy System Analysis for the North Sea region (IESA-NS) model. In this optimization model, the scenarios are run without any specific technology ban and under open optimization. The scenario results show that the deployment of an offshore grid provides relevant cost savings, ranging from 1% to 4.1% of relative cost decrease (2.3 bn € to 8.7 bn €) in the power-based, and ranging from 2.8% to 7% of relative cost decrease (6 bn € to 14.9 bn €) in the power-and-hydrogen based. In the most extreme scenario an offshore grid permits to integrate 283 GW of HVDC connected offshore wind and 196 GW of HVDC meshed interconnectors. Even in the most conservative scenario the offshore grid integrates 59 GW of HVDC connected offshore wind capacity and 92 GW of HVDC meshed interconnectors. When allowed, the deployment of offshore electrolysis is considerable, ranging from 61 GW to 96 GW, with capacity factors of around 30%. © 2022 The Author(s)"
2021,EMT real-time simulation model of a 2 GW offshore renewable energy hub integrating electrolysers,Energies,"Due to their weak nature, such as low inertia, offshore energy hubs are prone to un-precedented fast dynamic phenomena. This can lead to undesired instability problems. Recent literature, with main focus on onshore systems, suggests that electrolysers could be an attractive option to support wind generators in the mitigation of balancing problems. This paper presents an Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) model for real-time simulation based study of the dynamics of active power and voltage responses of offshore hubs due to wind speed fluctuations. The purpose of this study was to ascertain the ability of an electrolyser to support an offshore energy hub under different scenarios and with different locations of the electrolyser. Two locations of Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) electrolysers were considered: centralised (at the AC common bus of the hub) or distributed (at the DC link of the wind turbines). Numerical simulations conducted in RSCAD® on a 2 GW offshore hub with 4 × 500 MW wind power plants and 330 or 600 MW PEM electrolysers show that electrolysers can effectively support the mitigation of sudden wind speed variations, irrespective of the location. The distributed location of electrolysers can be beneficial to prevent large spillage of wind power generation during the isolation of faults within the hub. © 2021 by the authors.

2021,Analysing long-term opportunities for offshore energy system integration in the Danish North Sea,Advances in Applied Energy,"This study analyzes future synergies between the Oil and Gas (O&G) and renewables sectors in a Danish context and explores how exploiting these synergies could lead to economic and environmental benefits. We review and highlight relevant technologies and related projects, and synthesize the state of the art in offshore energy system integration. All of these preliminary results serve as input data for a holistic energy system analysis in the Balmorel modeling framework. With a timeframe out to 2050 and model scope including all North Sea neighbouring countries, this analysis explores a total of nine future scenarios for the North Sea energy system. The main results include an immediate electrification of all operational Danish platforms by linking them to the shore and/or a planned Danish energy island. These measures result in cost and CO2 emissions savings compared to a BAU scenario of 72% and 85% respectively. When these platforms cease production, this is followed by the repurposing of the platforms into hydrogen generators with up to 3.6 GW of electrolysers and the development of up to 5.8 GW of floating wind. The generated hydrogen is assumed to power the future transport sector, and is delivered to shore in existing and/or new purpose-built pipelines. The contribution of the O&G sector to this hydrogen production amounts to around 19 TWh, which represents about 2% of total European hydrogen demand for transport in 2050. The levelized costs (LCOE) of producing this hydrogen in 2050 are around 4 €2020/kg H2, which is around twice those expected in similar studies. But this does not account for energy policies that may incentivize green hydrogen production in the future, which would serve to reduce this LCOE to a level that is more competitive with other sources. © 2021"
2022,Modelling a highly decarbonised North Sea energy system in 2050: A multinational approach,Advances in Applied Energy,"The North Sea region, located in the Northwest of Europe, is expected to be a frontrunner in the European energy transition. This paper aims to analyse different optimal system configurations in order to meet net-zero emission targets in 2050. Overall, the paper presents two main contributions: first, we develop and introduce the IESA-NS model. The IESA-NS model is an optimization integrated energy system model written as a linear problem. The IESA-NS model optimizes the long-term investment planning and short-term operation of seven North Sea region countries (Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom). The model can optimize multiple years simultaneously, accounts for all the national GHG emissions and includes a thorough representation of all the sectors of the energy system. Second, we run several decarbonisation scenarios with net-zero emission targets in 2050. Relevant parameters varied to produce the scenarios include biomass availability, VRE potentials, low social acceptance of onshore VRE, ban of CCUS or mitigation targets in international transport and industry feedstock. Results show a large use of hydrogen when international transport emissions are considered in the targets (5.6 EJ to 7.3 EJ). Electrolysis is the preferred pathway for hydrogen production (up to 6.4 EJ), far ahead of natural gas reforming (up to 2.2 EJ). Allowing offshore interconnectors (e.g. meshed offshore grid between the Netherlands, Germany and the United Kingdom) permits to integrate larger amounts of offshore wind (122 GW to 191 GW of additional capacity compared to reference scenarios), while substantially increasing the cross-border interconnection capacities (up to 120 GW). All the biomass available is used in the scenarios across multiple end uses, including biofuel production (up to 3.5 EJ), high temperature heat (up to 2.5 EJ), feedstock for industry (up to 2 EJ), residential heat (up to 600 PJ) and power generation (up to 900 PJ). In general, most of the results justify the development of multinational energy system models, in which the spatial coverage lays between national and continental models. © 2021 The Author(s)"
2022,Grid integration and fault ride-through of fractional frequency offshore wind power system based on Y-connected modular multilevel converter,"IET Generation, Transmission and Distribution","Fractional frequency transmission is a promising solution to offshore wind power integration. This paper proposes a new grid integration scheme of fractional frequency offshore wind power system (FFOWPS) based on Y-connected modular multilevel converter (Y-MMC). To get better power quality, a novel Y-MMC modelling and control method considering frequency leakage is presented. Besides, in order to achieve satisfactory fault ride-through (FRT) performance for FFOWPS, this paper proposes a novel FRT strategy. The strategy makes use of the onshore grid voltage and offshore grid frequency droop control to coordinately control the power of Y-MMC and wind turbines. This strategy achieves power balance on both sides of Y-MMC through coordinated control, thereby suppressing the increase of DC capacitor voltage during faults. It is also able to support the grid by injecting reactive power during voltage sags. Additionally, a new pitch angle control algorithm is designed to keep the balance between input mechanical power and output active power of wind turbines during FRT, avoiding the rapid rise of rotor speed. The simulation results in MATLAB/Simulink demonstrate good performance of FFOWPS during wind speed variations and validate the effectiveness of the proposed frequency leakage suppression strategy and FRT strategy. © 2022 The Authors.

2021,"Onshore, offshore or in-turbine electrolysis? Techno-economic overview of alternative integration designs for green hydrogen production into Offshore Wind Power Hubs",Renewable and Sustainable Energy Transition,"Massive investments in offshore wind power generate significant challenges on how this electricity will be integrated into the incumbent energy systems. In this context, green hydrogen produced by offshore wind emerges as a promising solution to remove barriers towards a carbon-free economy in Europe and beyond. Motivated by the recent developments in Denmark with the decision to construct the world's first artificial Offshore Energy Hub, this paper investigates how the lowest cost for green hydrogen can be achieved. A model proposing an integrated design of the hydrogen and offshore electric power infrastructure, determining the levelised costs of both hydrogen and electricity, is proposed. The economic feasibility of hydrogen production from Offshore Wind Power Hubs is evaluated considering the combination of different electrolyser placements, technologies and modes of operations. The results show that costs down to 2.4 €/kg can be achieved for green hydrogen production offshore, competitive with the hydrogen costs currently produced by natural gas. Moreover, a reduction of up to 13% of the cost of wind electricity is registered when an electrolyser is installed offshore shaving the peak loads. © 2021 The Author(s)"
2022,Location alternatives generation and elimination of floatovoltaics with virtual power plant designs,Renewable Energy,"A floating photovoltaic solar power (floatovoltaics) systems' location alternatives generation and elimination application in Burdur is presented as a development activity of a proposed real-time robot and platform. Analytic Hierarchy Process as a weighting method, Weighted Linear Combination as a decision rule, and Ordinary Kriging as an interpolation method are applied with input layers like Global Horizontal Irradiance, wind speed, elevation, and power networks. 2 procedures are proposed for presenting discriminated and compound floatovoltaics suitability maps on all water bodies. Possibilistic power output estimations for virtual floatovoltaics systems on Burdur Lake and Karacaoren I Dam Reservoir are prepared based on the satellite images, hill shade, bathymetry, future drought analyses, and discrete power output estimations on Global Solar Atlas. The sensitivity analyses are also presented for investors. The capital expenditure estimations are made with a possibilistic approach too. The water conditions and projections are scary due to many irrevocable water use and precipitation problems. Hence, hybrid investments, and energy islands (hydro, photovoltaics, floatovoltaics, and similar) will be safer and risk-averse options. It is recommended to focus on sufficiently large, deep and calm water bodies too. This study is a good kick-off for the preliminary assessment of new floatovoltaics. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
2022,"Wave-induced sediment and rhodolith mobility on a narrow insular shelf dominated by wave variability (Fernando de Noronha Archipelago, Brazil)",Continental Shelf Research,"This study combines numerical modeling and empirical equations to define spatial fields of wave-induced sediment and rhodolith mobility in a narrow insular shelf that is subject to a seasonal wave regime: the Fernando de Noronha insular shelf. From analyses of the annual, summer and winter wave climates, we noticed an intense directional variability in swell waves coming predominantly from opposing directions between the studied seasons (northern swell in summer and southern swell in winter), reflecting higher wave energy on the north coast during summer and lower energy during winter. The longitudinal transport at the northern coast, which is predominantly oriented to the southwest, is also higher in the summer months and lower in the rest of the year. To describe the spatial variation in wave-induced mobility under summer and winter wave conditions, we consider empirical sediment movement equations, based on mean grain size and density values. Carbonate bioclastic sediments, which are predominant in the Fernando de Noronha shelf, are remobilized by waves throughout the entire shelf. However, in the nearshore zone, this movement occurs intensely for all sizes. The depth and shelf side affected by wave-induced mobility vary according to the wave climate variability that determines the direction and type of wave prevailing in the regime. When swell waves come from the north (summer scenarios), mobility is greater mainly on the northern shelf; however, when trade wind waves come from the southeast and swell waves come from the south (winter scenarios), greater movement is produced on the south face. Wave-induced sediment mobility occurs at depths of up to 60 m, near the shelf break, indicating the importance of the shelf morphology. The movement of rhodoliths, which presents a lower density and larger diameter than the sediments, eventually occurs under extreme wave conditions up to depths of approximately 30 m in areas that vary seasonally around the island according to the predominant wave direction. These characteristics are favorable to rhodolith development. With our results, we hope to better understand the wave action on the bottoms of high-energy island shelves by identifying the sediment movement patterns attributed to wave climate variability and morphological characteristics of the shelf. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
2021,A new way to account for large-scale flow effects of large wind farms for offshore energy hubs,WindEurope Electric City 2021 - WindEurope's Annual On- and Offshore Wind Energy Event,[No abstract available]
2021,Techno-economic system analysis of an offshore energy hub with an outlook on electrofuel applications,Smart Energy,"The integration of cross-sectoral energy hubs into large-scale wind farms opens up existing structures to new applications and contributes to achieving renewable energy systems and climate protection targets. The offshore energy hub concept consists in establishing an artificially constructed energy conversion and distribution hub that addresses two energy-related markets by power supply to public grids and by potentially enabling the conversion of renewable electricity into hydrogen or ammonia and supplying it ashore. Hence, the energy hub concept enables smart integration of offshore wind power into gas grids. Power generation on demand from stored green gas is able to cover residual power loads at low carbon intensity. Electrofuel production provides also the opportunity to export renewable fuels for sectors with traditionally high greenhouse gas emissions, e.g., agriculture or transportation. In this contribution an energy hub system in the North Sea is modeled and simulated to determine production quantities and efficiencies of electricity, hydrogen and ammonia. When comparing the efficiencies of production, storage, and transport values of 45.1–65% for hydrogen and values of 52–52.3% for ammonia were determined. Re-conversion to electricity with fuel cells of both hydrogen and ammonia is less efficient and cost worthly than their use in electrofuel applications. Because of emerging and potential cost reductions a sensitivity analysis is performed where lower capital costs (50%) lead to cost reductions in hydrogen (42–45%) and ammonia production (40–42%). Results show that energy hubs can become sustainable pillars in future energy systems through improving cost-competitiveness of wind power. © 2021 The Authors"
2022,A Novel Offshore Grid Forming Control Concept for Parallel VSC HVDC Bipoles,CIGRE Science and Engineering,"The North Sea Wind Power Hub consortium, a partnership between TenneT, Energinet and Gasunie, is considering an AC coupled hub con guration which uses multiple VSC HVDC bipoles connected through a common offshore AC bus to transmit wind potential to onshore load centers. This paper introduces a novel grid forming control concept to achieve tight voltage and angle/frequency control at the offshore hub while avoiding interactions between parallel converters. A master controller distributes power between HVDC bipoles while pole-level controllers de ne each converter’s internal voltage magnitude and angle. The unique dynamic characteristics of offshore grids and challenges of operating grid forming converters in parallel are discussed. Synchronous Grid-Forming control concepts were considered but, due to the characteristics of zero inertia in offshore grids, posed a signi cant challenge in avoiding interactions between parallel converters. The performance of the proposed grid forming control concept is demonstrated using EMT simulations. © 2022, CIGRE. All rights reserved."

This paper presents the accordingly adapted offshore HVDC control concept for AC-side parallel HVDC link operation and in detail compares the behavioral differences in case of direct offshore converter terminal coupling and coupling across own transformers. Negative impacts are obtained regarding unequal power distribution and the mapping of individual converter power limitations, thus control concept enhancements are suggested, assessed and successfully tested, aiming at control concept usage in more complex AC-side meshed offshore grids studied further on within NSON II.  © 2021 IEEE."

2021,Local distribution network management through optimal flexibility scheduling: The Austrian pilot of the Horizon 2020 MERLON project,ICPS 2021 - 9th IEEE International Conference on Power Systems: Developments towards Inclusive Growth for Sustainable and Resilient Grid,"The EU electricity system is going through a transition driven by increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and new energy marker actors, such as prosumers and aggregators. Decentralization of electricity generation can facilitate the integration of more renewable energy sources, increase security of supply and decarbonize the energy future. To benefit from these opportunities while keeping pace with the transformation of the power sector and evolving needs of energy market players, the EU Horizon 2020 project 'Integrated Modular Energy Systems and Local Flexibility Trading for Neural Energy Islands (MERLON)' has developed an integrated local energy management system (ILESEM) to support local distribution grid operation in a high-renewable energy scenario. ILESEM performs a multi-level optimization using decentralized intelligence for efficient coordination of DERs within a local distribution grid. This way, ILESEM is used to form a self-coordinated and self-balanced energy island while offering services to the wider electrical system. An algorithmic framework has been designed that optimally schedules battery energy storage, local generation, and demand side management offering a cost-efficient pathway (in comparison to high-CAPEX grid upgrade investments) for active local distribution grid management in the presence of high volumes of variable renewable energy. The effectiveness of DER scheduling in an Austrian pilot site has been demonstrated and replication of the solution in the Indian context has been explored.  © 2021 IEEE."
2022,CONSTRUCTABILITY ASSESSMENT FOR A NORTH SEA ENERGY ISLAND,WODCON XXIII Proceedings,"A constructability assessment is performed for an energy island located in the Doggerbank area of the North Sea. As the basis for the study a tentative island scope and dimensions of key elements are used. Given the harsh conditions of the North Sea, the construction methods, equipment and logistics chosen in this assessment are primarily based on intrinsic robustness. The workability is defined for 3 periods occuring each year. A summer period of 6 months and a winter period of 4 months. Statistically the months of December and January contain the most adverse conditions of the year and are therefore considered idle time. Construction of the rubble mound sea defences is not considered possible without protection. For this purpose a temporary cobble barrier is proposed, which is relocated along with the construction work front. Ultimately the cobbles are re-used in the cobble beach proposed as defence for the south of the island. Early availability of a work harbour should allow optimal supply and handling of construction materials. Reclamation works, comprising ~150 million m3, are mainly performed by a number of TSHD’s, well within available market capacity. For rock gradings and quarry run (in total ~4 million ton) a stock yard storage equal to half a year of production capacity is located nearby the work harbour. The concrete armour units (24-34 ton X-blocs and ~100 ton cubes with ~10 ton cubes as underlayer) are casted in a prefab yard in a North Sea port, shipped to the island, and stored in a stock yard nearby the work harbour. The sea defences are constructed simultaneously by marine and by land-based equipment, with a total work front of ~600 m, and progress of ~50 m/wk. The amount of equipment required is large, and without exception amongst the largest available in the industry. Special purpose equipment for handling and placing the ~100 ton armour cubes is proposed. Total construction time is ~7.5 years. Options to reduce this are limited, given time needed for preparations and the early works, and the size and amount of equipment already deployed. Reversely, constraints from for instance licenses could seriously reduce construction possibilities, so much care and attention is needed in the preparations for license applications. Caissons may be considered as an alternative to rubble mound sea defences. However, suitable weather windows for towing to site and immersion onto the foundation bed may not be very frequent, even in the summer. Also the construction of the foundation bed, with a top layer of gravel within tight vertical tolerances, is not particularly easy at open sea. The hydraulic and geotechnical design of the caisson, with the associated rock platform and berm, is considered a critical engineering challenge, given the unforgiving nature of the concept. Irrespective of the sea defence concept chosen, already during the design phase the constructability (practical and reliable construction methods and logistics) must be considered as well. This study provides examples of such methods. COPYRIGHT © 2022 CEDA."
2022,Optimization of offshore grid planning considering onshore network expansions,Renewable Energy,"In the coming years, an extensive development of offshore wind energy will present a clear trend of clustering offshore wind farms (OWFs). Offshore grid is a novel concept proposed to address the problem of connecting OWFs and integrating large offshore wind energy into the regional onshore power system economically and reliably. Compared with traditional electrical systems in large OWFs, the connection of offshore grid demonstrates some new features. This paper presents a tri-level optimization strategy to optimize offshore grid planning while considering onshore network expansions simultaneously. The proposed strategy turns the optimization of these two complicated electrical networks into three nested optimization models: the ‘Point of common coupling (PCC) optimizer’, ‘Offshore substation (OS) optimizer’, and ‘Offshore grid optimizer’. An engineering case from the East China Sea is discussed to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. The results show that offshore grid demonstrates better overall economic efficiency and less marine corridor consumption. In addition, the proposed methodology can make the integration of large OWFs more friendly to onshore networks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
2021,Online estimation of dynamic capacity of VSC-HVdc systems - Power system use cases,ETG-Kongress 2021 - Von Komponenten bis zum Gesamtsystem fur die Energiewende,"The dynamic capacity describes the capability of high voltage direct current (HVdc) systems to operate temporarily beyond their guaranteed active and reactive power (P/Q) limitations under specific conditions. In this work, the dynamic capacity is intended to be applied in various power system use cases to ensure a more efficient and secure grid operation. In contrast to previous works, the dynamic capacity is considered with a holistic view on the HVdc system's components. Moreover, to overcome existing limitations considering only the HVdc system design, it is introduced to estimate the dynamic capacity based on real-time operational data. In principle, dynamic capacity could help for any power system use case where temporarily additional capacity is required. The article details five use cases, including congestion management, voltage support, frequency response, offshore wind overplanting and grid planning to be of high interest for such a feature. The main HVdc applications, embedded systems, interconnectors and offshore grid connection, and anticipated time frames for dynamic capacity are highlighted from power system perspective. Also, the time-criticality of the remedial actions is outlined. © VDE VERLAG GMBH. Berlin. Offenbach"
2021,Entrepreneurial resource construction through collective bricolage on Denmark’s renewable energy Island: an ethnographic study,Entrepreneurship and Regional Development,"Entrepreneurial resource construction through bricolage is an underappreciated element in a growing body of entrepreneurship and organization studies examining bricolage as an organizational strategy under conditions of resource scarcity. Drawing on in-depth ethnographic data, this study of the Danish island Samsø’s successful transition to renewable energy argues for a richer understanding and a more positive appraisal of entrepreneurial bricolage as a multifaceted strategy for change on the community level. By demonstrating the constructed nature of the resource environments identified on Samsø, the article argues that bricolage, rather than revolving around the combination of already available resources to create new entrepreneurial ventures, is a process involving the construction of resources to achieve change. An in-depth understanding of this process of resource construction is especially relevant in the context of local sustainable energy transitions, as bricolage, in this context, can enable the community to work towards a shared goal without accepting the constraints of the resource-scarce local environment. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group."
2023,Start-up Control and Frequency Oscillation Control of the 100% Renewable Energy Islanded Grid Fed by MMC-HVDC System,"2023 5th Asia Energy and Electrical Engineering Symposium, AEEES 2023","With the expansion of renewable energy generation on a larger scale, especially wind and photovoltaic, the power system with a high share of renewable energy and even 100% renewable energy will become the primary direction of modern power system development. The main issue endangering the future security and stable functioning of the new power system will be the low inertia issue that the high proportion renewable energy system is currently dealing with. Without the support of synchronous power supply, how to realize a smooth start and reliable grid connection of the system and how to have good fault traversal capability in the face of disturbance will become difficult and hot issues of future research. In this paper, a standard system model of 100% renewable energy islanded grid fed by MMC-HVDC is built based on PSCAD/EMTDC. In accordance with this model, this paper proposes the start-up control scheme and the frequency oscillation control scheme of the standard system model of 100% renewable energy islanded grid fed by MMC-HVDC and verifies their effectiveness by simulation. © 2023 IEEE."
2022,Forecasting the electricity pricing of energy islands with renewable sources,Machinery and Energetics,"The strategy for the development of local low-power systems involves the use of several sources. The efficiency of functioning such systems depends on the purposeful reliability management and it is based on the rational hierarchical connections of their structural components. Coordination of the structure of diversified sources and their participation in the formation of energy balance of micro-energy systems in the conditions of dynamic development of renewable energy is an actual research task. The purpose of research was to develop a method of reliability-cost optimization of structure of micro-energy systems with dissimilar sources, which is based on the use of reliability indicators and cost of electricity. The studies conducted are based on the modern methods of applied statistical analysis, the theory of reliability, the synthesis of complex multi-aggregate systems. Through the implementation of the Markov model and simulation modeling of the functioning of sources, it has been obtained the conditions for optimal formation of the energy balance of micro-energy system with the lowest cost of electricity, considering the reliability indicators. Computational experiments made it possible to obtain the regularities of cost evolution of electricity and to show its dependence on the structure and algorithms of the sources’ functioning. Using a probabilistic modeling method, it has been proved for the first time that the cost of electricity is sensitive to the ratio availability of renewable sources of primary energy. The practical application of results lies in the increase in efficiency of energy islands through the structural and algorithmic optimization of diversified sources (traditional and renewable) based on determining the cost of electricity. © 2022, National University of Life and Environmental Sciences of Ukraine.

First, for the islanded microgrid system without grid support and dominated by inverters, the sequence impedance model is established based on harmonic linearization. Besides, the influence of the reactive power loop and control delay on impedance characteristics is analyzed. Then, based on the sequence impedance network model, the Nyquist stability criterion is constructed. The impact of system parameters on the steady-state operating point is fully considered, and the influence of the system steady-state point and control parameters on the stability of the microgrid system is analyzed in detail. Furthermore, based on the results of system stability analysis, a virtual impedance design method that adapts to the changes in system operating conditions is proposed, which significantly improves the system stability.

2021,"Energy Islands: Metaphors of Power, Extractivism, and Justice in Puerto Rico","Energy Islands: Metaphors of Power, Extractivism, and Justice in Puerto Rico","Energy Islands provides an urgent and nuanced portrait of collective action that resists racial capitalism, colonialism, and climate disruption. Weaving together historical and ethnographic research, this story challenges the master narratives of Puerto Rico as a tourist destination and site of ""natural"" disasters to demonstrate how fossil fuel economies are inextricably entwined with colonial practices and how local community groups in Puerto Rico have struggled against energy coloniality to mobilize and transform power from the ground up. Catalina M. de Onís documents how these groups work to decenter continental contexts and deconstruct damaging hierarchies that devalue and exploit rural coastal communities. She highlights and collaborates with individuals who refuse the cruel logics of empire by imagining and implementing energy justice and other interconnected radical power transformations. Diving deeply into energy, islands, and power, this book engages various metaphors for alternative world-making. © 2021 by Catalina M. de Onís."
2022,The EPLANoptMAC model to plan the decarbonisation of the maritime transport sector of a small island,Energy,"Islands have been identified as living labs for implementing innovative solutions so as to boost the green energy transition. In this context, energy modelling and planning are key to optimally design the future energy system and identify the most appropriate technologies for both power generation and energy system management. In this research, a Marginal Abatement Cost curve method, by means of the EPLANoptMAC model, is applied to identify the optimal energy mix for the island of Favignana, Italy. The optimisation uses the carbon avoidance cost as objective function in order to consider both environmental and economic aspects. In addition to standard technologies such as photovoltaic and battery energy storage demand response technologies that include the maritime transport and heating sectors are optimised. Particularly, the decarbonisation of the maritime transport sector is of utmost importance since it represents the biggest energy consumption and source of carbon dioxide emissions for small islands. Results show that photovoltaic is the main priority, followed by battery energy storages. Electric ferries are preferrable to hydrogen ones when enough renewable energy from photovoltaic is produced. The decarbonisation of the maritime transportation is preferable to the heating sector and is required to reach decarbonisation targets higher than 40%. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
2022,Mitigation of background harmonic amplification caused by offshore wind farm long AC cable integration,IET Renewable Power Generation,"The high voltage alternating current transmission with submarine cables is the common scheme to integrate offshore wind farms close to the land. Due to the capacitive effect of AC cables, the association of the long AC cables and the onshore grid can cause resonances, which may amplify grid background harmonics. This paper focuses on the mitigation of background harmonic amplification caused by offshore wind farm integration. First, the background harmonic amplification mechanism in the offshore wind farm integration system is analysed qualitatively, and the mitigation approaches are given in principle. Then, taking a practical project as a study case, the harmonic modelling methods of the offshore grid and the onshore grid are elaborated, including the harmonic models of wind turbines, transformers, cables, the high voltage and the extra-high voltage transmission grid, and the low voltage distribution network. According to the established harmonic models, the cause of background harmonic amplification is analysed. On this basis, two mitigation methods of installing the series blocking filter and the shunt filter are compared and the recommended mitigation scheme is proposed. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed scheme is verified by calculation results under different grid operating conditions. © 2022 The Authors.

2021,Medium frequency diode rectifier unit based HVDC transmission for offshore wind farm integration,IET Renewable Power Generation,"The offshore wind farms are the main trend of the wind power development in the future. The medium frequency diode rectifier unit based high voltage direct current transmission system is proposed here for offshore wind farm integration. Unlike conventional high voltage direct current solutions, the rated frequency of the offshore alternating current (AC) grid is increased to about 100∼400 Hz in the proposed system. Besides, a grid-forming control scheme for the wind turbine converters is also proposed in this paper, where the machine side converter controls the direct current (DC) voltage and the grid side converter controls its output alternating current voltage in the global unified reference coordinate system. As a result, smaller and lighter passive components, such as the transformers, alternating current filters and reactive power (VAR) compensators, could be adopted in the offshore grid, which is beneficial for achieving higher economic efficiency. The small stability analysis and the time domain simulation of the proposed system are carried out based on a simplified model and power systems computer aided design/electromagnetic transients including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC) respectively, and the feasibility of the proposed schemes is verified. © 2021 The Authors.

2022,"Energy Communities: Technical, Legislative, Organizational, and Planning Features",Energies,"Worldwide, the use of fossil fuels covers almost 80% of the entire energy needs. In the European Union (EU), 2020 represents a watershed: for the first time, renewables were the main source of electricity. In Italy, the latest surveys demonstrate an increase in the use of alternative energy sources. European legislative framework highlights the importance of these new trends encouraging (and imposing) the use of renewables. The necessity to become more proactive in the energy production–consumption process and in the achievement of sustainability targets brings people to create Energy Communities (ECs) to manage their own energy supply chain. The authors present an overview of the main legislative framework in the EU and Italy in relation to ECs, analyzing the energy consumption, the electricity and heat energy production potentiality, and the energy balance in a portion of an Italian middle‐size city in the Milan metropolitan area. Moreover, they underline the technical, regulatory, and planning possibilities to achieve energy independence, exchanging energy among the selected urban district when there is a surplus in production. Lastly, the authors underline the strengths and barriers to the development of ECs. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."
2022,Offshore grid topology optimisation with a geographical information system,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"A novel methodology is investigated to identify and optimise large scale offshore grid topologies connecting multiple wind farms and countries with each other. A Geographical Information System (GIS) is setup to cluster wind farms and create a permissive graph topology. Its purpose is to propose grid layouts with potential hub locations and landing points bottom-up in a fully analytical toolchain, while avoiding manual scenario building. A coupled market model performs the investment optimisation into new lines on the GIS created graph. This two-step procedure is demonstrated at the example of the Baltic Sea Region for the target year 2040. It can be found, that future offshore topologies benefit from bundled transmission paths and many clustered wind farms. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the topology results are sensitive for wind farm location assumptions and pre-defined interconnectors or hubs. Not least, the capability of the onshore grid to integrate the influx of offshore wind power and the level of detail it is modelled in, directly reflects on the topology results for the offshore grid. It is concluded that optimising the future offshore grid is a quest of pan-European scale which benefits heavily from geo data based pre-processing in a GIS. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

2022,Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on energy islands: The case of Cape Verde,Electric Power Systems Research,"The COVID-19 pandemic and its countermeasures radically affected the energy sector. Within a matter of days, whole countries were into lockdown causing the largest energy impact of the last decades. This study explores the pandemic and its effects on the isolated power systems of Cape Verde, a small island-based developing state in Africa. Historical data from 2013 to 2021 is combined with ARIMA-based forecasting to estimate a COVID-free scenario. The results show how the country's electricity demand suffered a 10% drop distributed among the islands proportionally to GDP per capita. The energy mix was unaffected, but the lower demand motivated 6% less emissions. The reliability of the system improved with respect previous years, but the transmission losses increased by 5% due to energy theft caused by the severe economic crisis suffered in the archipelago. In that sense, the impact on revenue and energy sector workers was quite limited. Furthermore, we also studied the effects of the pandemic in other energy related sectors such as water desalination and transport. The recovery started in the third quarter of 2020 as marked by the increased electricity demand, but also with the rapid growth of passengers and goods in the transport sector. © 2022 The Author(s)"
2021,Offshore Energy Hubs in Sector Coupled European Scenarios: Can Large-scale Wakes Hinder the Development?,IET Conference Proceedings,"Offshore energy hubs are moving from ideas in academic studies to reality, with Denmark going ahead with a hub or an island in the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. With multi-GW installations planned per hub, they can provide for the expected electricity consumption increase driven by electrification and sector coupling. Large-scale wake losses can be significant, and they get larger as hub size increases. Hub size impacts also the variability of the hub's generation. It is argued that these impacts are significant and should be considered in energy system optimisation. However, the high capacity factors achieved in far-offshore energy hubs still make them attractive in highly sector coupled future scenarios. © 2021 Energynautics GMBH."

The automatic controller, implemented in the Energy Management System (EMS) of E L I A sends setpoints of active power to the different wind parks, that have a total installed power of I GW taking into account not only the current and potential ñiture topology (i.e. potential additional incidents) and the forecast of ampacity calculated by a Real Time Thermal Rating system installed on the cables. The robustness and reliability of the system has been enhanced with the addition of dynamic alarms, automatic detection of non-compliant control actions from the parks and a local backup protection that disconnects automatically the cables in case of prolonged unacceptable overload. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings.

2022,From energy islands to energy highlands? Political barriers to sustainability transitions in the Baltic region,Energy Research and Social Science,"The European Green Deal strategy targets accelerated sustainability transitions, yet the pathways and processes thereto differ markedly across EU member-states, particularly in the energy sector. Politics and institutional contexts largely determine the transition dynamics. However, the sustainability transitions scholarship lacks concrete tools to identify such political barriers to transitions. This paper, therefore, asks: How do political barriers to sustainability transitions emerge and endure, driving differences in transition dynamics across countries? By integrating concepts from institutional economics with the sustainability transitions scholarship (the multi-level perspective), this paper introduces a theoretical framework to assess political barriers to sustainability transitions in their institutional contexts. Additionally, the paper provides empirical evidence from a new region for sustainability transition research: the electricity sectors in the Baltic states of Lithuania, Estonia, and Latvia. The comparative case study relies on 25 semi-structured interviews with senior energy policy stakeholders from the Baltic region, triangulated with content analysis of policy documents. The paper concludes that, first, political barriers to transitions emerge in their institutional contexts as they define the policy objectives (or lack thereof) that reinforce (or reduce) transition processes. Second, political barriers to sustainability transitions endure as lacking incentives, alongside misaligned rules and norms, hinder niche development across countries. This analysis suggests policy changes for policymakers and points to future research avenues. © 2022 The Author"
2022,Energy governance in Spain,Handbook of Energy Governance in Europe,"Spain is lagging behind in the transition to a sustainable energy system compared to other EU member states. Its unique position as an energy island, coupled with errors in energy planning inherited from previous government regimes, constitute a legacy that makes changes in the system difficult to achieve. Current political instability adds to the difficulties, under a governance framework characterised by lack of coordination and supremacy of the central government in the decision making process, in an environment where traditional energy companies still exert lobby power. The continuous changes in the regulatory framework of the energy sector have hindered investments in low carbon sources of energy due to perceived uncertainty. Small changes in the right direction are being observed though, with a more prominent role expected from the local levels ofgovernment. But many measures still originate on requirements linked to EU commitments and more initiatives at the national level need to be seen. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022. All rights reserved."
2021,Innovative Energy Storage Concept for Saipem Offshore Wind2Sub™ Application,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,"Reducing CO2 emissions is becoming one of the core targets for countries after the Paris agreement, which sets out a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. To meet this objective also oil and gas operators have started to engage in an important effort to reduce the CO2 emissions in their plants and facilities. From this perspective Saipem developed its Wind2Sub, a Wind Power for Long Subsea Tie-Back (LSSTB) concept, where its own pendular floating foundation solution, namely Hexafloat, can host a wind turbine generator (WTG), all the utilities needed for subsea field development and operation (power distribution, chemical storage and injection, control system) and a back-up energy system to compensate the intermittent production due to wind persistence, currently a diesel generator (DG). The present paper will explore new solutions to ensure the continuity of the energy supply from Saipem Wins2Sub, based on green technologies. This may be done by collecting the generated surplus energy from a renewable energy system, in this case from WTG to a topside or subsea power storage. By adopting an Energy Storage System (ESS), it will be possible to use this energy when production from wind is low or null. This concept will replace the diesel generators, or any carbon fuel, so that the whole system will become green self-sustaining, as an energy island, without CO2 emissions. The activities performed during the concept development are articulated through the following steps: a selection of two typical oil field scenarios where Wind2Sub solution can be applicable; screening of the current technologies to store energy and a selection of those viable to the two selected scenarios; wind conditions and WTG power analysis with estimation of the amount of the energy to be stored; preliminary design of the ESS; preliminary cost estimation. The study was carried out by using a digital tool developed by Moss Maritime in the context of a Proof of Concept based on Floating energy storage. The tool allows to evaluate the feasibility of a solution through modellization of different renewable energy scenarios, demand profiles, simulation of operation, pre-sizing of the systems and cost estimation (LCOE, LCOS, LCOH). The ESS combined with Saipem Wind2Sub will be described more thoroughly in the present paper through the explanation of the results achieved within the case studies. © 2021, Offshore Technology Conference.

2022,Day-ahead complex power scheduling in a reconfigurable hybrid-energy islanded microgrid with responsive demand considering uncertainty and different load models,Applied Energy,"This paper proposes a new operation management scheme (OMS) for next-day complex power scheduling in an islanded reconfigurable microgrid. Energy supply in the microgrid comes from wind turbines and photovoltaic generators as renewable dispersed generators (RDG). Meanwhile, there are two microturbine units and a fuel cell unit as dispatchable distributed generators (DDG). Also, a battery bank energy storage system (BESS) is integrated. The microgrid has a number of controllable tie-switches to change the microgrid configuration and supplies residential, commercial, and industrial loads with different electrical models. Some of loads participate in a demand control program. The OMS is mathematically formulated as a multi-period mixed-integer stochastic nonlinear optimization. It has to decide the hourly power share of each DDG, the states of the control switches, and specifications of demand response. The OMS aims to minimize the total operation cost, unmet load, and curtailed renewable power maintaining all technical constraints. The uncertainty of renewable resources and load is analyzed in the OMS by Monte-Carlo simulation while scenario-reduction approach is used to reduce the computational burden. Besides, a new version of bat algorithm (IBA) is developed as a robust optimization solver. Simulation results and comparative evaluation of the OMS are presented using a 45-bus case study system to prove the merits of the method. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
2022,Offshore energy hubs: Cost-effectiveness in the Baltic Sea energy system towards 2050,IET Conference Proceedings,"Offshore energy hubs connect large amounts of offshore wind to a hub from where the generation can be transmitted to onshore, potentially linking to multiple surrounding countries. The benefits of such hubs, and the related meshed offshore grid to connect them, have been investigated in the North Sea. The system-wide impacts of offshore energy hubs in the Baltic Sea are less studied; however, the region is seeing increased interest in offshore wind development. This paper uses detailed offshore wind generation simulations and energy system optimisation to investigate the cost-effectiveness of offshore energy hubs in the Baltic Sea in different scenarios towards 2050. The results show that the largest deployment of offshore energy hubs occurs when the energy system is highly electrified. The strongest development of the offshore energy hubs occurs in the southern part of the Baltic Sea. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings. All rights reserved."

2022,Optimal Secondary Control to Suppress Voltage Fluctuations in an HVDC-Linked Wind Farm Grid,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,"High-voltage direct-current (HVDC) systems using voltage source converters (VSCs) have been developed to suppress voltage fluctuations in offshore grids due to the intermittent power generation of offshore wind farms (OWFs). This paper proposes a new strategy for the optimal secondary voltage control of HVDC-linked OWFs. In the proposed strategy, optimal coordinated control of an HVDC system and OWFs is achieved to minimize real-time voltage fluctuations throughout an offshore grid. A full-order dynamic model of HVDC-linked OWFs is implemented, and its unobservable and uncontrollable state variables are then eliminated using a model reduction algorithm. Given the dynamic model, a linear quadratic Gaussian regulator is designed for optimal coordinated control, and an eigenvalue analysis is conducted focusing on the effects of communication time delays on the stability of the proposed strategy. Simulation case studies are also carried out to verify that the proposed strategy more effectively improves real-time regulation of offshore grid voltages, compared to conventional strategies, while ensuring voltage stability even for relatively large delays in communications systems.  © 1969-2012 IEEE."
2022,Techno-economic analysis of biogas production and use scenarios in a small island energy system,Energy,"This paper investigates the economic, energy and environmental benefits given by the installation of an anaerobic digester in a small island. Particularly, the island of Procida is chosen as a case study where the production of organic fraction of municipal solid waste is equal to 2477 t/year. Three scenarios are hypothesized for the use of the locally produced biogas, namely: (i) upgrading of biogas and injection into the gas grid for the residential sector (replacing 21% of natural gas consumption); (ii) upgrading and use in transport sector (covering waste trucks, non-organic waste ferry and shuttle buses consumptions); (iii) use of biogas in a Combined Heat and Power (CHP) plant (covering 4% of electricity consumptions). The scenarios are analysed and compared in economic, emissions and energy terms. Although the biogas covers just a small part of consumption, it can still provide a relevant contribution to the island energy system by diversifying the energy mix while increasing the renewable energy sources penetration and also increasing the independence. The results show advantageous payback time (4–5 years), and this is mainly due to the significant savings in the maritime transport and the partial avoidance of the waste disposal on the mainland the incentives. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
2022,50-kW Modular V2G SiC Charger Station in Energy Island Microgrids: a Real Use-Case in Madeira Island,PCIM Europe Conference Proceedings,"Inhabited islands are isolated energy microsystems, with challenges such as cost, pollution, robustness, and external dependency. Consequently, new solutions are needed to face climate change and the penetration of electric vehicles. The paper describes a real use-case in Madeira Island, where a modular and multi-protocol fully-SiC 50-kW V2G charging station has been designed and developed. On the one hand, a 4-leg AC/DC converter provides at the same time a V2G charging point, and a grid stabilizer with balancing capabilities. On the other hand, modular DC/DC resonant converters are used to cover a wide range of voltage and power possibilities, while adding high frequency galvanic isolation. © VDE VERLAG GMBH, Berlin, Offenbach."
2022,Simulation of intergranular fracture behavior inside randomly aggregated LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2 polycrystalline particle,Engineering Fracture Mechanics,"The degradation of secondary particles caused by intergranular fracture is an important reason for the capacity fading of LiNixCoyMn1-x-yO2 (NCM) polycrystalline electrodes. In this study, a chemomechanical damage model was established to implement a simulation of fracture behavior under different fracture energies, interfacial strengths and C-rates. Cohesive elements were applied along the interfaces of randomly distributed primary particles, generated by the Voronoi algorithm to simulate their separation during lithiation. The damage dissipation energy was calculated to characterize the propagation of cracks. The simulation results showed that the fracture energy and strength between primary particles play an important role in the intergranular fracture behavior. Increasing the C-rates brings two different aggravating effects to the fracture of secondary particles in different cycle stages. The extensive propagation of the main crack suppresses the growth of secondary cracks under a high C-rate or small fracture energy. Island particles and holes that appeared in many experiments after a long-term cycling protocol were simulated for the first time. The evolution of the simulated cracks was consistent with many published experimental images. The method and results are of great significance for understanding the fracture behavior of NCM cathodes. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd"
2021,Comparison of star and string offshore dc collector grid topologies on the aspect of stability—an impedance approach,Energies,"Offshore Direct Current (DC) collector grids are a promising technology for decreasing the installation and operation costs of offshore wind parks. Nevertheless, the stability properties and hence the design of such DC collector grids is not common or standardised. Hence, this paper describes an attempt to fill these gaps by analysing the stability of two different types of DC collector grids—star and string—by considering identical operating conditions. The approach follows a non-parametric formulation of the impedance based Nyquist Stability Criterion. The hyperbolic Π equivalent formulation of the telegraph equation is adopted for modelling the submarine cable due to high capacitance that is distributed and thus the conventional 50 Hz Π-model is not sufficient anymore. Furthermore, the paper shows how to integrate the complex dynamics of wind turbines into the overall stability assessment through an impedance building algorithm. Finally, it is shown how to stabilise the collector grids by means of active control parameter changes and it has been observed that the star configuration of wind turbines is more favourable on account of stability and controllability. © 2021 by the authors.

2022,ENERGY ISLAND IN THE NORTH SEA,WODCON XXIII Proceedings,"The Danish Parliament has agreed to initiate the realization of an artificial island to realise 10GW of offshore wind potential from the North Sea. The Energy Island is seen as the beginning of a new era for future development of Danish offshore wind and a cornerstone in the green transition. The Energy Island is located in the North Sea, about 100 km from the west coast of Denmark. Initially, the island shall handle 3GW of offshore wind power, and eventually the island shall be able to receive and transmit up to 10 GW offshore wind power. The wind energy produced shall be used to accelerate the green transition with the energy island serving as a hub for transmitting the energy to where it can bring the most value. Compared to other artificial islands around the world, this is more challenging as the island is located in a water depth of about 25-30 m and in a harsh environment with extreme design waves. Further, it is even more challenging from a construction point of view as it is located far from the coast and with limited weather windows for the marine construction activities. We are working for a group of investors intending to bid for construction of the island and to become the Commercial Co-owner with the Danish State having a majority ownership. Pre-qualification and bidding are planned for 2022 and 2023. The perimeter protection of the island shall be able to resist extreme design waves and to ensure functionality of the island. The perimeter structures are likely to be either rock revetments protected by large concrete units or concrete caissons whatever will be optimal considering cost, time and risk. The island platform will be formed by sand likely dredged from borrow areas in that part of the North Sea. COPYRIGHT © 2022 CEDA."
2021,Voltage and reactive power correlation in multi-objective optimization of an offshore grid,Automatika,"In the last few years, many offshore wind power plants are installed at North Sea and more are under construction. Offshore grid would be vital in the integration of future offshore wind power plant with the main land grid. Both, multi-terminal DC and AC cable systems are under consideration in the concept of future offshore grid. The reactive power and voltage operating point for such a network is important for the optimized operation. This article presents an optimization criterion of voltage and reactive power control for an offshore AC grid having a parallel connecting grid-forming converter. Multi-objective optimization problem is formulated considering four reactive power management strategies. The solution of the optimization algorithm is analysed and compared with respect to active power losses in the network, voltage variation, and reactive power contribution by the sources. The research presents a methodology to apply a suitable reactive power management strategy to achieve the best optimum operating points. The solution provides the optimum operating points for offshore wind farm reactive power, frequency and voltage droop gain values for VSC-HVDC system, and reactive power sharing factor of HVDC transmission. © 2021 The Author(s).

2022,North Sea Energy Islands: Impact on national markets and grids,Energy Policy,"Taking concrete steps towards a carbon-free society, the Danish Parliament has recently approved the establishment of the world's first two offshore energy hubs on Bornholm and on an artificial island in the North Sea. Being the two first-of-their-kind projects, several aspects related to the inclusion of these “energy islands” in the current market setup are still under discussion. To this end, this paper presents a first large-scale impact analysis of offshore hubs on the whole European power system and electricity market. Our study shows that energy hubs in the North Sea contribute to increase social welfare in Europe. However, when considering the impact on each country, benefits are not shared equally. To help the development of such projects, we focus on the identification of the challenges arising from the hubs. From a market perspective, we show how exporting countries are affected by the lower electricity prices and we point at heterogeneous consequences induced by new transmission capacity installed in the North Sea. From a system point of view, we show how the large amount of wind energy stresses conventional generators, which are required to become more flexible, and national grids, which cannot always accommodate large imports from the hubs. © 2022"
2022,HARMONIC DISTORTION PREDICTION METHOD FOR A MESHED TRANSMISSION GRID WITH DISTRIBUTED HARMONIC EMISSION SOURCES – EASTERN DANISH TRANSMISSION GRID CASE STUDY,IET Conference Proceedings,"Tremendous, fast green transition in Denmark initiates large-scale grid-integration of renewable energy sources, electrification of energy consumption, establishment of PtX and Energy Islands set goals for the transmission grid development, such as establishment of new connections, and grid reconstruction such as extensive substitution of overhead lines (OHL) with underground cables (UGC). The share of UGC in the Danish transmission grid is increasing. Presence of UGC has resulted in that resonances of the harmonic impedance characteristics of the transmission grid are brought within the harmonic order range coinciding with the harmonic distortion and causing systemwide increase of the harmonic voltage distortion in the 400 kV meshed transmission grid. Transformation of the 400 kV transmission grid arises needs of predicting the harmonic voltage distortion using simulation models to secure an adequate power quality and support investment decisions and harmonic mitigation for the grid stage which is not yet established and differs from the present grid. This paper presents a method of direct simulation of the harmonic voltage distortion, which is developed and applied by Energinet, Transmission System Operator of Denmark, using Eastern Danish 400 kV transmission grid as a case study. The main advantage of direct simulation is possibility to predict whether, where in the transmission grid, and for which harmonic orders, the not yet commissioned connections may cause violation of the IEC planning levels and which mitigation is necessary for bringing the harmonic distortion down below the planning levels with a given margin. Further, this paper briefly presents directions for the harmonic assessment in Denmark as part of an industrial PhD project by Energinet and Aalborg University. This joint work shall result in a guideline for prediction of the harmonic distortion in a meshed grid such as where and how an analytical approach can replace observational studies with many numerical simulations. © 2022 IET Conference Proceedings.

2021,Unlocking the UK continental shelf electrification potential for offshore oil and gas installations: A power grid architecture perspective,Energies,"Most of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS) oil and gas (OG) installations have traditionally adopted in situ power generation, which is not only inefficient but also generating about 70% of the offshore CO2 emissions. The offshore wind and energy storage technologies for deep water are developing at a fast pace, enabling great opportunities for the OG installations located in the North Sea. In this paper, a pathway for the UKCS offshore OG installations electrification is introduced. The aim is to provide different power architectures that facilitate the OG installations’ electrification, while benefiting from the existing and planned UK offshore wind power. Four hypothetical case studies (based on real data) were created, along the UKCS, where the corresponding power architectures were proposed. The selection of each architecture power component (e.g., transformers, converters and cables), as well as the transmission and distribution technology (e.g., AC or DC), is also provided and justified. Further, an overview cost estimation is carried out to predict the architecture capital cost. It is concluded that the four architectures can be mimicked not only along the UKCS but also worldwide, promoting the UKCS potential for a world-leading offshore energy hub and fostering the UK offshore wind-energy resources. © 2021 by the authors.

The legal challenges of connecting offshore wind farms to multiple countries,Journal of Energy and Natural Resources Law,"Massive deployment of offshore wind is a core building block of the EU’s climate and energy strategy. So-called ‘hybrid assets’ can be used to connect offshore wind to the onshore grid. A hybrid asset is a connection between at least two countries, to which offshore wind farms are also connected. The connection transports offshore-generated electricity to shore, while facilitating electricity trade through additional interconnection capacity. The current EU Electricity Market Regulation is not fit for this purpose, holding back the development of hybrid assets.

2021,Water cycle driven only by wind energy surplus: Towards 100% renewable energy islands,Desalination,"This paper studies how to increase the share of renewable energy by using solely stand-alone renewable energies to drive the water cycle. A case study is undertaken of El Hierro (Canary Islands, Spain), an island already on the path to becoming a 100% renewable energy island thanks principally to a wind-hydro power plant that covered around 60% of the annual electricity demand in 2018. The island's water cycle includes groundwater extraction, seawater desalination and water pumping and distribution, representing altogether around 35% of the annual electricity demand of the island. The idea is to investigate the possibility of driving the entire water cycle solely with the wind energy surplus. For this purpose, two scenarios are considered and developed: one based on the existing decentralised water cycle, and the second on an alternative centralised one, with just one modular reverse osmosis desalination plant and a centralised water storage system. The aim is to establish which model adapts best to an intermittent energy source such as wind energy without conventional backup systems. Results show that both scenarios lead to an increase in the overall renewable energy contribution in the island. Moreover, the centralised water model, specially due to its centralised water storage system, allows a higher contribution from renewable energy sources, increasing their overall annual penetration. © 2021 The Authors"
2021,ORION: Shaping shetland as the UK's first green energy Island,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - SPE Offshore Europe Conference and Exhibition 2021, OE 2021","The ORION (Opportunity Renewables Integration Offshore Networks) project was launched in April 2020 when Shetland Island Council (SIC) and the OGTC formed a strategic partnership to work on an energy hub concept with Highland & Islands Enterprise (HIE), government and industry. Strathclyde University joined in May 2021 as a strategic partner. Shetland has all the critical ingredients of clean energy provision There is significant onshore and offshore wind and tidal resource; strategically important hydrocarbon resource; established oil and gas infrastructure; and a knowledgeable and skilled local workforce. The aim of ORION is threefold:- • To enable offshore oil and gas sector transition to net zero by electrification, utilising initially onshore and then offshore wind, sustaining thousands of jobs and security of supply. • To transform Shetland's current dependency on fossil fuels to affordable renewable energy to address fuel poverty and improve community wealth. • To create a green hydrogen export business on Shetland at industrial scale by harnessing offshore wind power and creating new jobs. ORION has set several ambitious targets by 2050. These include abating 8mT/year of CO2 from offshore oil and gas production; supplying 32TWh of low carbon hydrogen annually - 12% of UK expected requirement; and generating more than 3GW of wind. The annual revenue generated by the project by 2050 would be around £5Bn per annum and provide sustainable employment, both locally and regionally, for 1750 people.

2022,An Asymmetric Control Strategy for Bipolar VSC-HVDC Connected Islanded New Energy,"Proceedings - 2022 IEEE International Conference on Energy Internet, ICEI 2022","Under the background of vigorously developing new energy power generation technology, photovoltaic, wind power, and other new energy power generation technologies have been developed continuously. The voltage source converter based high voltage direct current (VSC-HVDC) plays an important role as a transmission technology widely used in large-scale new energy delivery. The reliable and flexible bipolar structure can be adopted to improve the transmission capacity and voltage level of VSC-HVDC, however, the adoption of traditional V/f control strategy for bipolar VSC-HVDC system may lead to instability due to the control of same target of positive and negative poles. In order to realizes the stable operation of the bipolar VSC-HVDC system in the new energy island delivery scenario, an asymmetric control strategy with V/f control adopted by positive converters and the constant active and negative power (P/Q) control for negative converters is proposed. In addition, a power-balancing control approach, which is necessary to balance the active power between positive and negative poles is proposed in this paper. The proposed control strategy is simulated in the case of new energy output power fluctuation and AC fault, and it is verified that the control strategy keeps the power balance of the positive and negative pole and shows excellent dynamic characteristics.  © 2022 IEEE."
2021,Reducing the cost of maintaining the frequency stability using dc grid protection,SEST 2021 - 4th International Conference on Smart Energy Systems and Technologies,"This paper quantifies the operational cost of maintaining the frequency stability in a scenario when the largest loss of infeed originates from an offshore grid. The loss of infeed is considered only temporary, by taking advantage of fast dc grid protection. The power restoration curve is used to define the impact of protection on the stability and sensitivity analysis of its parameters is performed. A North Sea based grid topology shows a significant benefits of using a faster and more selective protection. Consequently, a FS protection strategy is recommended for the topology. The topological changes have a considerable impact on the cost and a meshed system that can restore the power to a higher level is highly cost effective. © 2021 IEEE."
2021,Techno-economic and environmental assessment of energy vectors in decarbonization of energy islands,Energy Conversion and Management,"Decarbonization and transformation of the power system go beyond integrating large shares of variable distributed energy sources; it implies understanding the increasing flexibility needs of the power system and breaking barriers in the process of transforming passive users to active participants in future low carbon energy systems. Unlocking the potential of final users and transforming them into distributed flexibility providers requires harmonization of operation through new models such as the association in energy communities. Multi-vector energy communities (MEC) can provide further flexibility options, enable integration of local energy generation and empower energy islands to increase self-sufficiency and resilience to external impacts. In line with this, the paper develops a unified mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of a MEC and rigorously assesses techno-economic performances of different combinations of energy sources, vectors and consumers. That way, the potential of different MECs for providing flexibility and increasing the utilization of electricity production from local renewable energy sources is assessed. Based on the results of the MILP models, the paper further proposes novel indicators for estimation of the techno-economic and environmental potential of different multi-energy vectors in decarbonization of energy islands. Case study analysis comprises of eight scenarios with different MEC's setups with realistic data from island Ærø in Denmark and island Vis in Croatia, capturing also geographical specificities. The results show significant differences across different MEC set-ups as well as between the geographical locations, and some of the results that can be highlighted are: demand responsive electric heat pumps and use of battery energy storage systems provide stand-out energy potency and can ensure self-sufficiency with smallest capacity of electricity production from local renewable energy sources, but comes with a growing costs for the increase of storage capacity; use of imported natural gas as a transition fuel could be affordable solution but does not lead to fulfilment of self-sufficiency or environmental goals; hydrogen energy vector has significant potential, especially in cases where seasonal energy storage is needed but the costs are still a main barrier; correlation of production and consumption patterns in island Ærø in Denmark favor wind energy, while the increased capacity and production from solar plants is more favorable in island Vis in Croatia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"
2022,UPCOMING CHALLENGES FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF ENERGY ISLANDS IN THE NORTH SEA,WODCON XXIII Proceedings,"The construction of energy islands in the North Sea poses several challengers to the developers, designers and marine contractors. In this paper, three concepts are considered for a small energy island. The concepts are compared on relative costs, CO2 emission during construction and constructability. All three concepts are judged technically feasible, but especially their risk profile in construction shows significant differences. For an energy island of some 8 ha typical designs for the three concepts are presented and the volumes of material involved are calculated. These volumes are the basis for a construction analysis of the concept, the associated risk on delay due to severe weather and possible measures to reduce the risks. The construction challenges associated with the concepts, the relative costs and the CO2 emission during construction can support authorities and developers in selecting locations and preferred concept for the energy islands to be developed in the North Sea.

2022,Generation of energetic ions with non-Maxwellian energy distribution from a double-layer target irradiated by an ultra-intense laser pulse,Journal of the Korean Physical Society,"Carbon ions and protons from a double-layer target, a copper foil coated with a polymer exhibit non-Maxwellian spectral shapes, when an ultra-intense laser pulse with a high temporal contrast ratio was focused on the metal side of the target. The spectral shapes, showing strong reduction of low-energy ions, a high-energy island, and a modulated structure, are different from a typical thermal distribution usually obtained from a pure metal target in the laser acceleration of ions. In the case of C6 + ion, a high-energy island with an energy spread of 0.5 MeV/u was observed, which is separated from the low-energy spectrum by 0.2 MeV/u. A modulation in the proton energy spectrum was observed, which leads to a secondary peak at 2.2 MeV/u in addition to a peak at a low energy of 1.5 MeV/u. The maximum energy obtained from the double-layer target at a laser intensity of 3 × 1020 W/cm2 is 3.4 MeV/u for C6 + ions and 10 MeV/u for protons, which are higher than those obtained from a single metal foil by factors of 1.7 and 1.3, respectively. Such a spectral shape and energy enhancement could be accounted for by a bulk electrostatic field formed at the metal-polymer interface and multi-species interactions. These results show that the spectral shape of the ion beam can be tailored with an adequate structure of micrometer-thick target. © 2022, The Korean Physical Society."

2022,Modelling and analysis of offshore energy hubs,Energy,"Clean offshore energy hubs may become pivotal for efficient offshore wind power generation and distribution. In addition, offshore energy hubs may provide decarbonised energy supply for maritime transport, oil and gas recovery, and offshore farming, while also enabling conversion and storage of liquefied decarbonised energy carriers for export. In this paper, the role of offshore energy hubs is investigated in the transition of an offshore energy system towards zero-emission energy supply. A mixed-integer linear programming model is developed for investment planning and operational optimisation to achieve decarbonisation at minimum cost. We consider offshore wind, solar, energy hubs and subsea cables. A sensitivity analysis is conducted on CO2 tax, CO2 budget and the capacity of power from shore. The results show that: (a) a hard carbon cap is necessary for stimulating a zero-emission offshore energy system, (b) offshore wind integration and power from shore can more than halve current emissions, but offshore energy hubs with storage may be necessary for zero-emission production, and (c) at certain CO2 tax levels, the system with offshore energy hubs can potentially reduce CO2 emissions by 49% and energy losses by 10%, compared to a system with only offshore renewables, gas turbines and power from shore. © 2022 The Author(s)"
2021,The EPLANopt model for Favignana island's energy transition,Energy Conversion and Management,"Energy costs, carbon dioxide emissions, security of supply and system stability are common challenges in small islands all over the world. The European Union identified islands as perfect sites to implement innovative solutions to boost the energy transition towards a sustainable, independent, secure and low carbon energy system. In this framework, energy planning is an indispensable tool to optimally design the future energy system selecting proper renewable energy sources as well as the optimal flexibility strategies such as electric energy storage or sector coupling solutions. Energy system modelling represents one of the most used method for energy planning; indeed, energy models enable to simulate the real energy system functioning as well as its operation costs. Nevertheless, not many researches using multi-objective optimisation have been applied to insular case studies. In this paper, the EPLANopt model is applied to the case study of the Favignana Island in order to investigate the optimal configurations of the island energy system in 2050 with a multi-objective analysis. In order to appropriately analyse the case study of a non-interconnected island, an additional constraint is analysed to preliminary consider the system stability. The model is used to evaluate different energy mix, based on high penetration of renewables, considering several solutions for handling the excess electricity production (namely, electricity energy storage, power to heat and power to transport solutions) and to improve the overall energy efficiency (i.e. solar collectors and heat pumps). Results show that sector coupling solutions would lead to much greater impact in terms of carbon avoidance and economic savings managing the non-dispatchable renewable generation and maintaining the critical excess electricity production within feasible values. Results show that Favignana should indeed bet on photovoltaic and if vehicle-to-grid strategies are largely adopted the need for electricity storages is strongly reduced. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

When the ship DC netting daily inverter power supply system is connected / disconnected from the shore power grid, it will produce impulse current and impulse voltage at the moment of connection / disconnection. Moreover, ship DC network parallel / off is a complex process with multiple operating conditions and multiple working modes. Most previous studies have not taken this into account. Only one control strategy is used in the process of parallel / off-grid, which is difficult to achieve good results. In this paper, the flexible parallel / off-grid control technology of daily inverter power supply system is studied according to various working states of daily load converter in ship DC networking. The technology adopts different control strategies in different periods to stabilize the impulse voltage and impulse current at the moment of parallel / off grid. Finally, the effectiveness of the control method is verified by building a simulation model. The simulation results show that the voltage distortion can be suppressed by adding synchronous control; The introduction of grid connected control can alleviate the impact current at the moment of grid connected. According to the different working conditions of ship docking / offshore grid connection process, synchronous control and grid connection control are adopted in time-sharing, which can realize the smooth connection / separation of DC network electric propulsion ship from shore power.  © 2021 IEEE."

2022,Analysis of Principal Factors on Energy Consumption of Expressway Service Buildings,Energies,"As commercial transportation complexes, expressway service buildings have large passenger flow and a poor energy-saving effect, and have become the focus of energy conservation and emissions reduction efforts in the transportation field. At the same time, the particularity of the function determines that it is within the scope of no municipal supporting facilities, which renders them typical energy island-type buildings. This paper takes the expressway service buildings in a cold area as the research object, and carries out the correlation and partial correlation analysis of the factors influencing the operating energy consumption of the air-conditioning system. For the analysis of factors affecting the energy consumption of expressway service buildings during the operation period, considering that most of the service buildings are in the form of heating and cooling air conditioners, this paper chooses to represent the “refrigeration period” with a more obvious degree of influence. At the same time, during the operation period, because the ontological characteristics have been determined according to the analysis results, the outdoor meteorological characteristics are the main factors affecting the energy consumption of expressway service buildings. These include the dry bulb temperature and horizontal plane solar irradiance index, as well as the indoor comprehensive environment parameters: temperature, CO2 concentration index, indoor personnel density index. Based on the above analysis, a low energy consumption operation strategy for the air-conditioning system is proposed.

2022,Can Frequency Be Used to Achieve Communication-Less Primary Control in Photovoltaic-Storage Islanded Microgrids?,"2022 Workshop on Blockchain for Renewables Integration, BLORIN 2022","In the new energy scenario Renewable Energy Sources are playing a central role especially if energy islands are concerned. In particular, energy islands without synchronous generation, for example photovoltaic storage, are of major interest if one aims at a sustainable transition of these systems. In this Microgrid structure Grid-Forming and Grid-Feeding inverters need to be properly managed in order to cope with the features usually provided by the main power grid, i.e. frequency and voltage regulation. This paper wants to provide an analytical demonstration that even in no-inertia islands, the system frequency is still a suitable signal to provide frequency regulation and thus to guarantee the power balance and primary frequency regulation without any need of additional communication among generating units. © 2022 IEEE."
2022,Integrated Control Strategy Supporting the Optimal Management of a 3-kW Vanadium Redox Flow Battery: a Case Study for an Islanded DC Microgrid,"2022 IEEE Energy Conversion Congress and Exposition, ECCE 2022","This paper presents an integrated control strategy for the decarbonization of an islanded DC microgrid including one micro gas turbines (MGT), an organic photovoltaic system, a wave energy converter and a vanadium redox flow battery in the service of the upstream auxiliary loads of an off-shore oil rig. An optimized energy management system is proposed to control the microgrid power flow with the objective of minimizing the CO2 emission from the supporting MGT while exploiting the flexibility of control of the specific storage technology to achieve high efficiency and large energy capacity. The novelty relies on a mixed use of techniques, some of which typical of energy system planning and other of primary controls, because currently the grid under study only operates on 2 MGTs and we had to provide the comprehensive solution to verify how to decarbonize such services for the near future, along with its economics. © 2022 IEEE."
2022,Deposition of Co islands on Cu(111) and Cu–Al(111): A comparative study from DFT calculations,Vacuum,"The growth behaviors, stability and magnetic moments of Co islands on Cu(111) surface and Cu–Al(111) alloy surface were compared by means of Density Functional Theory calculations. Similar to the case of Pb-precovered Cu(111), it was found that the diffusivity of Co adatom on Cu–Al(111) was lower than that on Cu(111), which could suppress the agglomeration of Co atoms on Cu–Al(111). Such behaviors could be explained by the different electronic structures of surface atoms of Cu(111) and Cu–Al(111). Co adatoms deposited on one monolayer Co island descending a Co edge step to substrate terrace via push-out/exchange mechanism is more favored than direct hopping on both surfaces, and push-out/exchange descent is more favorable on Cu–Al(111) than Cu(111) with similar “Schwoebel-Ehrlich” barrier and larger exothermic reaction energy. Island formation energies calculated suggest layer-by-layer growth mode is more favored for Co islands deposited on Cu–Al(111) covered with Co films than that on Cu(111). In agreement with experiments, layer-by-layer growth is identified for Co islands on Cu–Al(111), suggesting perfect wetting of Cu–Al(111) by Co. Our calculations show Al impurities in Cu(111) enhance the stability and magnetic moments of Co islands, which may shed light on Co/Cu–Al(111) being potential applications in magnetic hyperthermia treatments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd"

The role of local balancing is growing and there is a need for the creation of local organizational structures aimed at separating part of the power infrastructure. This raises not only technical but also organizational, legal and economic challenges.

2021,Overview of sources of microgrids for residential and rural electrification: A panorama in the modern age,Residential Microgrids and Rural Electrifications,"Microgrids operate independently of the primary energy distribution network (islands) or synchronized with the primary energy distribution network. Microgrids are small-scale electrical networks that are often powered by a combination of solar, wind, or biomass energy to provide reliable green energy, though they may use fossil fuel energy resources. Microgrids can move the energy in response to peaks and troughs in supply and demand, resulting in no interruption in the power supply. A microgrid based on a viable model of microgeneration distributed from renewable sources with energy storage and energy management system is a strategic theme that leads to breaking paradigms. This technology meets the requirement of constituting an independent electrical system configured as a kind of ""energy island."" In this generation, storage and consumption can work connected to the distribution network. A microgrid design seeks to integrate distributed generation sources, such as solar photovoltaic and wind energy, more efficiently with the electric grid and improve energy quality and availability levels. Microgrids have generation units locally, based on renewable sources and energy storage units, allowing them to operate in isolation, with only local resources, or connected to the electricity grid of the company's energy concessionaires. This chapter aims to provide an updated overview of sources of microgrids and technologies, showing the fundamentals of this disruptive technology, incorporating solar energy and energy from photovoltaic cells, with a brief bibliographic background featuring the potential of these technologies. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.

2018,A mechanism for allocating benefits and costs from transmission interconnections under cooperation: A case study of the North Sea offshore grid,Energy Journal,"We propose a generic mechanism for allocating the benefits and costs that result from the development of international transmission interconnections under a cooperative agreement. The mechanism is based on a planning model that considers generation investments as a response to transmission developments, and the Shapley Value from cooperative game theory. This method provides a unique allocation of benefits and costs considering each country's average incremental contribution to the cooperative agreement. The allocation satisfies an axiomatic definition of fairness. We demonstrate our results for three planned transmission interconnections in the North Sea and show that the proposed mechanism can be used as a basis for defining a set of Power Purchase Agreements among countries. This achieves the desired final distribution of economic benefits and costs from transmission interconnections as countries trade power over time. We also show that, in this case, the proposed allocation is stable. Copyright © 2018 by the IAEE. All rights reserved."
2020,FRT Dynamic Analysis and Stability Enhancement of MMC-HVDC Connected Offshore Wind Farms Employing Voltage Drop Control,IET Conference Proceedings,"Voltage drop method is generally accepted for the fault ride-through (FRT) control of VSC-HVDC connected offshore wind farms. However, it may lead to the dc-link voltage fluctuation and further deteriorate the dynamic stability. This paper reveals above phenomenon for the first time and analyses its coupling mechanism. The instantaneous power of the MMC arm and phase unit are derived and it indicates that the dc current component induced by the offshore voltage drop leads to the fundamental-frequency ripple in the dc-link voltage. Two available internal control schemes are presented for MMC stations to improve the FRT dynamic stability by suppressing the dc-link fluctuation. Simulation results show that the presented energy-based method can suppress the fluctuation of dc-link voltage effectively and improve the stability of offshore grid through the FRT period. © 2020 The Institution of Engineering and Technology"
2020,Optimal generation and transmission development of the North Sea region: Impact of grid architecture and planning horizon,Energy,"— The European Union is pushing to achieve a sustainable, competitive and secure energy supply in Europe. This has translated into significant long-term renewable energy targets towards 2050, and the ambition to improve the European grid. A large share of this development is expected to occur in the North Sea. This paper investigates which transmission architecture is the most beneficial to integrate large shares of renewable energy in the North Sea region, and the consequences of the planning horizon when planning such a system towards 2050 are analysed. This is achieved by performing investment optimisation of generation and transmission for different scenarios. It is found that: 1) an integrated offshore grid configuration planned over a long planning horizon leads to cost minimization; 2) the grid topology is not likely to influence the penetration of variable renewable energy, but it will affect the contribution of each variable renewable energy type and the system costs; and 3) not taking the future into account when developing the energy system is likely to lead to a more expensive system. These results remark the importance of long-term planning horizon for energy systems and grid expansion and calls for a political focus on planning and international cooperation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"
2019,Toward a 100% renewable island: A case study of Ometepe's energy mix,Renewable Energy,"Despite generally having significant renewable energy potential, islands tend to depend on imported fossil fuels with volatile prices. This paper aims to provide technical inputs for reorganizing the energy planning for Ometepe Island. The result of the wind and solar resource assessments indicates wind power densities of 147 W/m2 and 178 W/m2 at elevations of 80 m and 120 m, respectively, and an irradiation level of 5.3 kWh/m2/day. The estimated wind LCOEs are significantly lower than current diesel plant operating prices. Photovoltaic systems will probably become cost-effective 15 years from now for all non-subsidized end customers. However, it would be necessary to store energy to phase out diesel generation, and analyses were conducted to determine the possibility of a pumped-storage hydro plant. The annual biogas potential was estimated as ∼550,000 Nm3, and in conjunction with electric stoves, it could be used to replace other fuels for cooking. Electric buses are an option for replacing the current diesel-run public buses, but advantageous financial conditions and reorganization of the bus schedules would be required. Also, a street lighting program was found to be cost-effective. The renewable energy transformation of the island might act as a role model for energy transition in Nicaragua. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
2018,Tuning of cascaded controllers for robust grid-forming voltage source converter,"20th Power Systems Computation Conference, PSCC 2018","From the origin of the grid, energy has been delivered to electrical loads mainly by synchronous machines. All the main rules to manage the grid have been based on the electromechanical behavior of these machines which have been extensively studied for many years. Due to the increase of HVDC link and renewable energy sources as wind turbine and PV, power converters are massively introduced in the grid with a fundamentally different dynamic behavior. Some years ago, they were connected as simple power injector. Then, they were asked to provide some ancillary services to the grid, in the future, grid forming capability will be required. Even if grid-forming converters had been extensively studied for microgrids and offshore grids, it has to be adapted to transmission grid where the topology may be largely modified. This paper presents an algorithm for calculating the controller parameters of a grid-forming converter which guarantee a stable behavior for many different configurations of the grid. © 2018 Power Systems Computation Conference."

These challenges result in high energy costs and CO2emissions. In order to promote a shift towards cleaner energy systems, islands have to invest on RES and smart solutions for sustainable energy supply. The present study examines the feasibility of RES introduction in the Maltese energy system. The research firstly assesses the island's RES potential, the environmental constraints and the energy consumption. Secondly, it analyses the feasibility of increasing the RES penetration in the local energy grid by means of the EnergyPLAN software.

2018,Design and optimization of a power hub for brazilian off-shore oil production units,"ECOS 2018 - Proceedings of the 31st International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems","A worldwide trend to reduce greenhouse gases emissions has encouraged researchers to study more efficient solutions in diverse sectors, including Oil and Gas Industry. Most of offshore units are energized by redundant equipment operating at low loads, turning their energy consumption inefficient and increasing environmental impact. This work aims at identifying the optimal design of a gas and steam turbine combined cycle tailored for offshore oil production applications. The Brazilian pre-salt basin is taken as a case study to improve operational efficiency and reduce CO2 emissions of floating oil production units. The idea is to concentrate the power supply to a floating power plant, composed of combined cycle power blocks. A model is developed, integrating the design of the gas turbine, heat recovery steam generators (single pressure and double pressure), steam turbine and condenser. Genetic algorithms are applied in two optimization approaches, single-objective and multi-objective. Three parameters are evaluated: equipment purchase cost, thermal efficiency and total weight. The results of the multi-objective optimization indicate that dual-pressure arrangement steam cycles, featuring 3 gas turbines, 1 HRSG and 1 steam cycle, could be an attractive design solution for power hubs. This arrangement has a low cost and weight, while the thermal efficiency is maintained at a reasonable high level (around 53.2 %). Moreover, the results indicate that by introducing a power hub, the CO2 emissions may be reduced by 18.7 % to 27.2 % compared with a conventional FPSO design. © 2018 University of Minho.

2021,Point-To-Point Low-Frequency AC Transmission of Offshore Wind Power Using Voltage Source-Based AC/AC Converter,Lecture Notes in Electrical Engineering,"This paper approaches an alternative way of transmitting wind power at low-frequency AC (LFAC) mode from the offshore grid to the onshore grid. At the onshore station, a voltage source converter (VSC)-based AC/AC converter is implemented in this study. Replacing the cyclo-converter and connecting wind power to a weak grid or even to a passive network. Whereas the cyclo-converter has a limitation of connecting to the only stiff grid. This approach gives the competitive options for VSC high voltage DC (HVDC) with regards to the multi-terminal HVDC network problem as the transmission distance and power transfer improves by using LFAC (1/3 of nominal frequency) approach. It also facilitates to independently controls the AC voltage and active power requirement. The requirement of filter will also be decreased which is normally more in line commutated converter (LCC) -based cyclo-converter. So, the wind power with LFAC can be interfaced with any type of AC network by using VSC-based AC/AC converter. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd."
2017,Review on DC collection grids for offshore wind farms with high-voltage DC transmission system,IET Power Electronics,"Traditionally, the network composition of offshore wind farms consists of alternating current (AC) grid; all outputs of wind-energy conversion units (WECUs) on a wind farm are aggregated to an AC bus. Each WECU includes: a wind-turbine (WT), a generator and a power transformer. For a DC collection grid, all outputs of WECUs are aggregated to a DC bus. The transformer in each WECU is replaced by a converter which is more compact and smaller in size compared with the transformer, thus simplifying the wind farm structure. The use of AC offshore grids instead of DC offshore grids is mainly motivated by the availability of protection devices. Efficient solutions to protect DC grids have already been addressed. Presently, there are no operational DC wind-farms, only small-scale prototypes are being investigated worldwide. Therefore, a suitable configuration of the DC collection grid, which has been practically verified, is not available yet. This study discussed some of the main components required for a DC grid including: the WT-generator models, the control and protection methods, the platform structure, and the feeder configurations. The key component of a DC grid is the converter; therefore, this study also reviews some topologies of converter suitable for DC-grid applications. © 2017.

2019,Modeling of multiterminal HVDC offshore grids with renewable energy and storage integration by opensource tools,"2019 Offshore Energy and Storage Summit, OSES 2019","With increasing offshore wind penetration levels, more secure and flexible offshore electrical transmission systems are needed to ensure security of supply to onshore users. When considering long distances of electrical power transmission, HVDC grids based on the modular multilevel converter (MMC) are a solution for present and future large scale offshore wind integration. As HVDC grids are developing into large and complex systems, dynamic analyses are useful to gain knowledge on the interactions between the different components in the grids. This paper uses the open source tool OpenModelica as modeling environment to demonstrate the potential of the tool in modeling such HVDC systems. A three-terminal HVDC system with offshore wind and energy storage integration is implemented in OpenModelica, and the dynamics of the system are investigated through four simulation cases. The main focus of this paper is dynamics and operation related to the HVDC system. The simulation results show that the MMCs can improve the most rapid power fluctuations using its internal storage capabilities, while an external energy storage system provides a more constant power flow over more extensive periods, in addition to improving the operation of the HVDC system. All models used in this paper are made publicly available to anyone for any purpose, including future studies of larger HVDC grids. © 2019 IEEE."
2018,A generic framework for power system flexibility analysis using cooperative game theory,Applied Energy,"Electricity grid infrastructures provides valuable flexibility in power systems with high shares of variable supply due to its ability to distribute low-cost supply to load centers (spatial), in addition to interlinking a variety of supply and demand characteristics that potentially offset each others negative impact on system balance (temporal). In this paper, we present a framework to investigate the benefits of alternative flexibility providers, such as fast-ramping gas turbines, hydropower and demand side management, by using a generation and transmission capacity expansion planning model. We demonstrate our findings with a multinational case study of the North Sea Offshore Grid with an infrastructure typology from year 2016 and operational data for year 2030 – considering a range of renewable capacity levels spanning from 0% to 100%. First, we show how different flexibility providers are allocated geographically by the model. Second, operational cost savings are quantified per incremental unit of flexible capacity. Finally, we present a way to rank different flexibility providers by considering their marginal contribution to aggregate cost savings, reduced CO2 emissions, and increased utilization of renewable energy sources in the system. The Shapley Value from cooperative game theory allows us to assess the latter benefits accounting for all possible sequences of technology deployment, in contrast to traditional approaches.

E-LAND is a European project which concept is to develop a service bus application enabling energy islands to optimize the management of energy production and consumption, which focuses on communities of end-users’ needs instead of addressing the system operators’ requirements. In this new organization of the energy market, the risk ownership on devices and energy costs are shared by the energy islands, the grid owner and the energy supplier. To support the energy islands in their new role, the E-LAND final product must not add risk in the management of energy. Thereby, a risk assessment is performed to ensure that the concept, the solution, and the application to be delivered in E-LAND are safe, secure, and reliable.

2019,"Understanding the social dynamics of consumer energy choices - Some lessons learned from two H2020 projects (ECHOES, SMARTEES)",Eceee Summer Study Proceedings,"This paper presents analyses based on data from two H2020 projects coordinated by the author. In ECHOES, energy choices of consumers are studied from a multilevel perspective, including particularly the question, how choices framed as group choices (e.g., choices people living in a particular region, city or country) differ from choices framed as individual choices. Results from a representative multinational survey with more than 18,000 respondents conducted in all EU member states plus Switzerland, Turkey, and Norway are presented. In the survey, an online experiment was conducted manipulating if predictors of energy saving behavior were introduced as a choice with a connection to other people in the region, the country, or the European Union. The analyses show that intentions to support the Energy Transition by energy saving behavior are impacted by the degree a person embraces an environmental identity, the feeling of being morally obliged (personal norms), the feeling of individual efficacy, but also social norms and the degree of identification with the people in the respective geographic entity (municipality, country, EU). Citizens of the different countries differ strongly in the degree they identify with their municipality or the EU in relation to their country and the degree of how strong they perceive the social norms and individual efficacy in their municipality or country in relation to the EU. Whereas identification with the EU is usually rather low in most countries, social norms to save energy are experienced to be stronger on the EU level than on the lower levels. Also, efficacy is perceived to be higher on the EU level. These findings are supplemented by preliminary findings from the SMARTEES project, which studies the diffusion of five types of social innovations in energy (inclusive mobility planning, energy autonomous islands, introducing car-free “superblocks” in cities, city quarter revitalization through energy effectivization, fighting fuel poverty through participatory energy efficiency plans). For this paper, first findings of the ongoing social network analyses in the social innovation cases are presented, outlining who key actors in such innovation cases are - again underlining the important function of communication, interaction and decision-making in groups. Two cases were selected (the Danish “Energy Island” Samsø and the Swedish eco-neighbourhood Augustenborg in Malmö). In both cases, it becomes obvious that successful social energy innovations require the collaboration of a complex network of actors sitting at key positions in the social networks. Long term restructuring of local societies requires individuals that have the ability to engage larger fractions of the diverse network of different actors. Across both projects, this paper makes a strong case for studying consumer-driven energy choices towards energy sufficiency and innovation from a social systems perspective, rather than a technological or overly individualistic perspective. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

2019,Towards 100% renewable energy islands: The role of the water cycle,"ECOS 2019 - Proceedings of the 32nd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems","El Hierro Island (Canary Islands, Spain) has become a referent of 100% renewable energy island. Gorona del Viento Wind-Hydro Power Plant already covers around 60% of its annual electricity demand (2018), often hitting peaks of 100%. In this context, the energy-water nexus is one pillar to become a 100% renewable energy island. Water resources management, which includes groundwater extraction, seawater desalination, water pumping and distribution, represents around 35% of the annual electricity demand of the island, a clear sign of the interdependency between energy and water. In this context, the aim of this study is to propose a strategy to increase the share of renewable energies by supplying the water cycle load only with wind energy. The potential surplus of wind energy has been estimated, concluding that the wind production could theoretically be increased by 28% (wind energy that is currently not being produced). Therefore, the scenario proposed is to supply the whole water cycle (groundwater extraction, seawater desalination, pumping and distribution) only with wind energy and propose the strategies needed to guarantee the water supply during the whole year. According to our results, the coupling between wind energy and the water cycle does not only contribute to better integrate intermittent renewable energy generation but also to the decarbonization of the desalination sector. © 2019 Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems.All rights reserved."

In total, the KF CGS utilizes above 520 km HVAC cables, and, in the Danish side, above 200 km 220 kV cables arranged into a meshed offshore transmission grid. As the cables approach critical lengths, the reactive power generation is dependant on the active power transfer. In the Danish side, the control is realized by an automatic voltage and reactive power control (AVR/RPC) of several switchable and variable reactors and transformers with tap-position controllers, and the Wind Power Plant Controllers (WPPC). In the German side, the voltage control is achieved by the HVDC Back-to-Back and WPPC and part of the Optimal Power Flow (OPF) by the Master Controller for Interconnector Operation (MIO).

2018,Estimation of investment model cost parameters for VSC HVDC transmission infrastructure,Electric Power Systems Research,"Investment model cost parameters for VSC HVDC transmission infrastructure continue to be associated with high uncertainty and their validity remains a crucial challenge. Thus, it is the key objective of this analysis to identify a new cost parameter set providing better investment cost estimates than currently available cost parameter sets. This parameter estimation is based on a previously conducted review of investment model cost parameters including its collection of existing cost parameter sets and project cost reference data. By using a particle swarm optimisation, the overall error function of the review's evaluation methodology is minimised to obtain an optimal parameter set. The results show, however, that the optimised parameter sets are far from being realistic and useful, which is why an improved overall error function is developed. Effectively penalising negative and near-zero cost parameter coefficients, this new overall error function delivers a realistic and well-performing cost parameter set when being minimised. In fact, the new parameter set produces better cost estimates for back-to-back, interconnector, and offshore wind connection projects than any of the existing cost parameter sets. Therefore, it is a valuable contribution and shall be considered in future grid investment analyses involving VSC HVDC technology. © 2018 Elsevier B.V."
2018,Expansion planning of the North Sea offshore grid: Simulation of integrated governance constraints,Energy Economics,"The development of offshore transmission and wind power generation in the North Sea of Europe is advancing fast, but there are significant barriers to an integrated offshore grid in the region. This offshore grid is a multi-level, multi-actor system requiring a governance decision-making approach, but there is currently no proven governance framework for it, or for the expansion planning of the European power system in general. In addition, existing offshore expansion planning models do not endogenously include governance considerations, such as country vetoes to integrated lines. We develop a myopic Mixed-Integer Linear Programming model of offshore generation and transmission expansion planning to study the effect of integrated governance constraints. These constraints limit investments in integrated lines: non-conventional lines linking offshore wind farms to other countries or to other farms. Each constraint affects the system (including the main transmission corridors), transmission technologies and welfare distribution differently. We apply our model to a long-term case study of the 2030–2050 offshore expansion pathways using data from the e-Highway2050 project. Results confirm that the offshore grid is beneficial to society. Integrated governance constraints induce a modest loss of social welfare, but do not change significantly the existing welfare distribution asymmetry between countries and actor groups. They do strongly affect the interaction of line technologies and types (conventional or integrated), so the impact of the integrated governance constraints is more visible on the grid topology than on welfare levels and distribution. We highlight the need to consider technology and type interactions in expansion planning, especially between multiterminal HVDC and integrated transmission lines. Also, an offshore governance framework should address the use of multiterminal HVDC in a non-integrated grid, but this is a second-best option compared to an integrated grid. © 2018 The Authors"
2017,Cluster-based DC grid control strategies applied to a European offshore grid scenario,"2017 52nd International Universities Power Engineering Conference, UPEC 2017","This paper presents a novel cluster-based approach for operation and control of multiterminal offshore high-voltage dc (HVDC) grids equipped with voltage source converter (VSC) technology. While conventional optimal power flow algorithms for ac transmission systems focus on minimizing generation costs, wind forecast uncertainties and future bulk power transfers preset by contracts between Transmission System Operators require new concepts for control of future offshore multiterminal dc (MTDC) grids. Based on already installed and future planned offshore wind farms in the North Sea, power generation of a wind farm for one time step using specific wind power curves including limited availability, wake effects and dynamic shut off as well as a method to allocate wind power plants to HVDC offshore converter stations are outlined. A sequential Newton Raphson acdc power flow algorithm was developed to cluster MTDC grids into different zones assuring an export of power from wind farm clusters to different control or market areas. The two main control objectives for MTDC grid operation are minimum grid transmission losses and fulfilment of guaranteed power transfers to specific market areas. To provide proof of the overall applicability, acdc power flow simulations were carried out on a specially developed future European Offshore Grid Scenario using real forecasted offshore wind speed data. © 2017 IEEE."
2019,Planning a meshed HVDC offshore grid in the North Seas,CIGRE Science and Engineering,"In many regions of the world, offshore wind energy is expected to become a major energy resource in the upcoming decades. This is the case for the European North Seas, where up to 205 GW of installed offshore wind parks are expected to be developed by 2050 according to the most ambitious scenarios. To transfer this offshore wind energy to the shore, a dedicated network infrastructure will be required. Because a significant part of this wind energy will also be located far from the shores, the use of HVDC technology will probably be required. Thanks to the ongoing development of HVDC breaker technology and related protection systems, a meshed HVDC offshore grid linking offshore wind parks and onshore grids in different countries can be developed. Several studies already demonstrated that the development of such a grid in the North Sea can bring substantial benefits. Such a grid can be used not only for the evacuation of the offshore wind energy, but also to exchange power between the different North Sea’ countries and possibly other benefits such as supporting the stability of onshore AC grids. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a prefeasibility study of a meshed offshore HVDC grid in the North Sea by looking at both the economic and the technical feasibility, carried out in the context of the European H2020 project “PROMOTioN”. A prerequisite of this prefeasibility study is the definition of a set of technical criteria that need to be fulfilled by the meshed HVDC offshore grid. If planning criteria are well defined for onshore grids (e.g. N-1 security criterion), this is not the case for offshore grids: there is no standard guideline to plan such a grid. This paper begins thus with the drafting of a set of planning criteria for an offshore grid, based on a review of planning criteria for onshore grids, for connection of offshore wind farms and for HVDC interconnectors. Furthermore, there is no unique way to develop a European offshore grid. Several strategies of development are possible and feasible, which could consequently lead to very different offshore grid structures (topologies). The challenges will be dependent on the strategy applied. This paper develops possible “Concepts” for a future offshore grid. Finally, two specific concepts are analysed in more detail, by developing the corresponding grid structure over the time period 2020-2030, and by analysing the corresponding costs and benefits. © 2019, CIGRE.

2018,Substations for offshore wind farms: A review from the perspective of the needs of the Polish wind energy sector,Bulletin of the Polish Academy of Sciences: Technical Sciences,"Offshore renewable energy, and in particular the offshore wind energy sector, is still developing in many countries around the world. Wind offshore projects are characterized by the need to build offshore electric power transmission infrastructure. Offshore substations are a key element of submarine electric power transmission systems. Due to the environmental conditions, an offshore substation is constructed as an indoor facility located on a platform. Depending on the offshore wind farm capacity, there are various solutions for platform and substructure designs used for the substation. Numerous economic and technical analyses indicate a significant potential for the development of offshore wind energy in Poland. By 2030, this potential is set at 6 GW of installed capacity, taking into account 2.2 GW of power included in the connection agreements being concluded. The main objective of this paper is to present the prospects for the development of offshore wind energy in Poland, and to describe the various offshore substation solutions and the different aspects of substation operation. Offshore wind energy resources and power capacity are also presented. Moreover, solutions for offshore substation platforms, electrical equipment and layout, functions of offshore substations in the power systems and offshore substation designs are described. © 2018 De Gruyter Open Ltd.

2018,Economic and environmental benefits from integrated power grid infrastructure designs in the North Sea,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"The North Sea Offshore Grid (NSOG) is considered an important contributor towards large-scale integration of renewables and electricity market coupling. Different typologies have been studied for such a multinational power grid, ranging from radial point-to-point connections to more integrated meshed typologies. An artificial island enables a high level of integration of both offshore wind power and transnational trade due to economies of scale. This paper present multiple case studies of the Power Link Island (PLI) which is visioned by TenneT in the Doggerbank area. Our results demonstrate that the capabilities of such an island could add significant value to the system as a result of more efficient use of geographically spread, cost-efficient resources. However, depending on the future level of grid integration and generation mix, the added value of a PLI varies between e0.15bn to e20bn. Consequently, this could result in 18% more efficient utilization of renewable resources, primarily offshore wind, and significant reductions of CO2 emissions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."

2019,Impedance-based analysis of harmonic instabilities in HVDC-connected Offshore Wind Power Plants,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,"HVDC-connected Offshore Wind Power Plants (OWPPs) with a large number of power converters are prone to instabilities due to interactions with converter controllers. This paper analyzes harmonic instabilities in OWPPs connected through HVDC due to interactions with the offshore HVDC converter and the wind turbine converters. An impedance-based model is used to represent a detailed OWPP with fully-rated converter based wind turbines, including the offshore HVDC converter, wind turbine converters, submarine cables and transformers of the offshore AC grid. Harmonic stability is evaluated both from the grid connection point of the offshore HVDC converter and the WT grid side converters. As a result, the influence that parameters of converter control systems and the offshore grid configuration have on harmonic resonant frequencies and stability conditions is analyzed in depth through a sensitivity analysis. Active damping implemented as a feed-forward control is coordinated in all converters to mitigate the harmonic instabilities. Examples of harmonic instabilities and active damping application are validated with time domain simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

2018,Innovative energy islands: Life-cycle cost-benefit analysis for battery energy storage,Sustainability (Switzerland),"Cities are concentrations of economic, social, and technical assets, which are fundamental to addressing climate change challenges. Renewable energy sources are growing fast in cities to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions in response to these challenges. In this transition urban decentralized energy shares technical and economic characteristics with energy islands. This is reflected in that island energy systems essentially operate off-grid which as a modus operandi can offer lessons to small-scale urban systems. With the expansion of urban areas, communities, especially small-scale ones, are sometimes further away from the main power infrastructure. Providing power supply to these communities would require significant investment to the existing power system, either to improve its grid infrastructure or power supply facilities. The energy islands have for some time now lent themselves to energy innovation including smart grid and battery storage applications. In this research we conceptualize that urban energy communities can be benefitted by knowledge transfer from energy islands in several fronts. We specifically put forward a life-cycle cost-benefit analysis model to evaluate the economics of battery storage system used in small communities from a life-cycle perspective. In this research we put forward a novel cost-benefit analysis model. Our results show that the inclusion of externalities can improve the economic value of battery systems significantly. Nevertheless, the economic performance is still largely dependent on several parameters, including capacity cost, discharging price, and charging cost. We conclude that existing electricity price structures (e.g., using household electricity price as a benchmark) struggle to guarantee sufficient economic returns except in very favorable circumstances; therefore, governmental support is deemed necessary. © 2018 by the authors."

2020,Low-Carbon Community Adaptive Energy Management Optimization Toward Smart Services,IEEE Transactions on Industrial Informatics,"With the rapid development of society and the economy and the increasing seriousness of environmental problems, renewable energy and high-quality energy services in low-carbon communities have become popular research topics. However, a large number of volatile distributed generation power systems in the community are connected to the grid. It is difficult to stabilize and efficiently interact with fragmented and isolated energy management systems, and it is difficult to meet energy management needs in terms of low-carbon emissions, stability, and intelligence. Therefore, by considering operation costs, pollution control costs, energy stability, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, this article proposes a regional energy supply model called community energy Internet and builds a low-carbon community energy adaptive management model for smart services. Then, to address energy supply instability, an adaptive feedback control mechanism developed based on model predictive control is introduced to adapt to the changing environment. Finally, a long short-term memory-recurrent neural network-based Tabu search is introduced to prevent the multiobjective particle swarm optimization algorithm from easily falling into a local optimum. The simulation results show that the proposed model can effectively realize the optimal allocation of energy, which solves the problem of fragmented energy islands caused by distributed power access. This method has quality of service benefits for users, such as cost, time, and stability, and realizes wide interconnections, high intelligence, and low-carbon efficiency of community energy management. © 2005-2012 IEEE."

2020,Hierarchical Multi-objective Safety Margin Optimization of Renewable Energy Island Collecting Delivery System by VSC-HVDC; [新能源柔直汇集系统的分层多目标安全裕度优化],Dianwang Jishu/Power System Technology,"Large-scale renewable generation integration and DC power grid are two hot subjects in the future power grid. The renewable generation cluster is connected to the voltage sourced converter (VSC) station, under the control mode of VF, forming a renewable energy island colleting delivery system based on High Voltage Direct Current with VSC (VSC-HVDC). Compared with the AC delivery mode, this mode has higher controllability and better adaptability, in which the voltage support is dominated by the control strategy of VSC station and coordinated with the reactive voltage control of the AC collecting network. However, the optimization of the safety margin of VSC station becomes a key problem affecting the system security because it may change rapidly with the working conditions caused by the strong fluctuation of the renewable energy. This paper proposes a multi-objective optimization method of safety margin for VSC station based on station-network coordination. The voltage of the point of common coupling (PCC) is used as the inter layer exchange variable. The voltage of PCC is determined by the reactive voltage safety margin optimization of VSC station in the upper layer, while the economic optimization of the renewable collecting network is achieved based on the voltage of PCC in the lower layer. In this way the optimization of safety margin is realized which satisfies the needs of multiple objectives, like network loss, reactive voltage safety and so on. Finally, the simulation verifies that the proposed optimization strategy can get a high and stable safety margin in different working conditions based on the renewable energy delivery system of an actual VSC-HVDC project. © 2020, Power System Technology Press.

2019,A preliminary techno-economic comparison between a grid-connected and non-grid connected offshore floating wind farm,"2019 Offshore Energy and Storage Summit, OSES 2019","Non-grid connected (NGC) floating offshore wind (OW) turbines can signify a solution for harvesting wind energy far offshore, addressing some key issues including the deep waters and lack of grid connection, while also exploiting the higher capacity factors. Towards this direction, on-board energy storage in the form of hydrogen production is one of the most promising solutions, often cited in literature. This study aims to perform a preliminary techno-economic analysis to assess the trade-offs, in terms of cost, between a far offshore grid-connected (GC) floating wind farm and a NGC wind farm integrated with an electrolyser for the production of hydrogen. To this end, a lifecycle techno-economic model coupled with an OM model developed for offshore wind installations are employed. The model is applied to a hypothetical wind farm located 200km from the shore. For the GC system, OM costs along with the costs of acquisition of the electric system (offshore cable and offshore substation) appeared to be the main contributors to the Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE). As far as the NGC system is concerned, it was concluded that a higher annual capacity factor (>60%) could potentially achieve viability of the investment. © 2019 IEEE."
2020,A New Control Scheme for Fast Frequency Support from HVDC Connected Offshore Wind Farm in Low-Inertia System,IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy,"Large-scale renewable energy integration and consequent displacement of synchronous machines result in low system inertia. Low system inertia leads to high rate of change of frequency, higher frequency nadir, and potentially require higher primary frequency reserve to stabilise system frequency following a sudden generation shortfall. To address such frequency stability issue in wind energy integrated system, this paper has proposed a new and realistic control strategy for inertial and primary frequency support from HVDC connected Offshore Wind Farms (OWF). The proposed control strategy, which is based on offshore AC voltage control is not only addressing limitations of high rate of frequency change in the offshore grid, but also does not result in any frequency deviation in the offshore grid while providing frequency support to the main grid. The proposed control strategy is robust for any frequency deviation in the main grid, which utilises HVDC converters to map onshore frequency variation in to voltage variation in the offshore grid, thus enabling adequate inertial and primary frequency support from the OWF. The proposed control strategy has been tested on two test systems and the results are compared with conventional method to demonstrate the robustness, effectiveness and reliability of the proposed frequency support strategy.  © 2010-2012 IEEE."

A grid topology with transmission capacity above 1 GW connecting offshore wind farms (OWFs) at distances close to 100 km in a standardized, modular, and cost-efficient manner is the focus of this paper. An electromagnetic transient (EMT) model was built in PSCAD in which OWFs are connected with 66-kV cables to a centralized offshore platform and a transmission link with a capacity of 1050 MW. The 66-kV cables will be coupled to three converter transformers connected to each other on the valve side and not on the 66-kV side. The link to the onshore transmission network uses VSC-HVDC technology with MMC topology.

2019,Mathematical harmonic model of VSC HVDC for offshore applications,IET Conference Publications,"HVDC transmission with Modular Multilevel Converter (MMC) technology is frequently used for connection to weak offshore grids. In such systems, adverse harmonic resonances and instabilities can occur due to the interaction between the different power electronic converters and the grid. Models of the HVDC converters describing their harmonic behaviour are needed by HVDC manufacturers at design stage and they are required by Transmission System Operators to allow prediction of such interactions and their impact on the grid. This paper describes one such model. It aims to be a comprehensive tool to analyse and predict harmonic interactions combining the control system, normally represented in dq frame, and the power system, normally analysed in the positive-negative sequence frame. This methodology can be applied to any device connected to the power system to capture key aspects of harmonic interaction including cross-coupling between harmonic frequencies. Moreover, such a tool will enable design of robust control systems. The process described in this paper is applied to a typical MMC-HVDC converter connected to an offshore grid. The mathematical model is validated through PSCAD simulation, and a practical case study is shown. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology.All rights reserved."
2019,Application of point on wave controlled switching on high voltage systems for weak offshore grids,"Society of Petroleum Engineers - Abu Dhabi International Petroleum Exhibition and Conference 2018, ADIPEC 2018","At offshore oil and gas islands, on site generators running independently are often utilized. These on site generators have their benefits but also pose their own drawbacks and may have their own problems. Due to the instability of those weak offshore grids, the grid disturbances may cause power outages, voltage fluctuations, changes in frequency, blackouts …etc. which are easily felt by the consumers and can also impact the performance and the service life of the electrical equipment. A study has been performed to examine different methods to improve the reliability of the overall network. Circuit breakers are designed to react by opening or closing the circuit as soon as a command is received. While doing so, the circuit breakers go through tremendous high stresses which ultimately may cause it to produce an arc. This phenomenon can be mitigated and reduced using controlled switching. This technology involves pre-defined control strategy for opening and closing each circuit breaker pole independently. Controlled switching methodologies are used to minimize the stress on circuit breakers, prevent failure of electrical equipment and improve power quality without affecting the overall grid. This new cost effective technology helps in reducing disturbances while improving electrical reliability to the end consumer. High Voltage Shunt Reactors, Subsea Cables and Transformer Energization and De-energization cause high inrush current on the system. Power system study software has been utilized to identify which loads will provide the optimum benefit when implementing the Controlled Switching application. This paper addresses the benefits of using controlled switching on high voltage circuit breakers on weak offshore grids. This paper also studies the applications and advantages of controlled switching of 132kV long subsea cable and transformer feeders wherein high inrush current is expected while showing the outcomes of research results and actual scenarios that have been implemented. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers."

Then, an integrated offshore grid is modelled to investigate the viability of connecting future transmission and offshore wind generation investments. These two scenarios are then compared. It is shown that going towards an integrated solution can increase offshore wind investments by several GWs, with Germany seeing the biggest difference between the two scenarios.

2018,Extended Current Limitation for Unbalanced Faults in MMC-HVDC-Connected Wind Power Plants,IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,"Modular multilevel converters (MMCs) are currently used in a number of high-voltage dc (HVdc) projects connecting very remote offshore wind power plants to shore. For this application, the offshore HVdc voltage-source converter provides the reference for voltage and frequency, that is, grid-forming operating mode. In fault ride through situations, however, the converter reactive current increases and has to be limited to protect the equipment. At the same time, the injection of maximum currents into the offshore grid is advantageous for fault detection and isolation by circuit breakers and to maintain the voltage level. State-of-the-art current limitation might underuse the converter capability in the grid-forming operating mode in specific unbalanced conditions. This paper proposes an extended limitation method for the converter current references for these conditions. It is demonstrated that the proposed method improves the voltage and current profile. In addition, the impact on the internals of the MMC is outlined. Dynamic simulations are conducted to validate the proposed extended limitation for two operation scenarios. The results demonstrate an enhanced utilization of the MMC capability, a better voltage profile, and improved transient behavior of the MMC for the proposed extended limitation compared to the normal limitation during specific unbalanced conditions. © 1986-2012 IEEE."
2019,Dressing for the Anthropocene*: A future history,Eceee Summer Study Proceedings,"This paper presents analyses based on data from two H2020 projects coordinated by the author. In ECHOES, energy choices of consumers are studied from a multilevel perspective, including particularly the question, how choices framed as group choices (e.g., choices people living in a particular region, city or country) differ from choices framed as individual choices. Results from a representative multinational survey with more than 18,000 respondents conducted in all EU member states plus Switzerland, Turkey, and Norway are presented. In the survey, an online experiment was conducted manipulating if predictors of energy saving behavior were introduced as a choice with a connection to other people in the region, the country, or the European Union. The analyses show that intentions to support the Energy Transition by energy saving behavior are impacted by the degree a person embraces an environmental identity, the feeling of being morally obliged (personal norms), the feeling of individual efficacy, but also social norms and the degree of identification with the people in the respective geographic entity (municipality, country, EU). Citizens of the different countries differ strongly in the degree they identify with their municipality or the EU in relation to their country and the degree of how strong they perceive the social norms and individual efficacy in their municipality or country in relation to the EU. Whereas identification with the EU is usually rather low in most countries, social norms to save energy are experienced to be stronger on the EU level than on the lower levels. Also, efficacy is perceived to be higher on the EU level. These findings are supplemented by preliminary findings from the SMARTEES project, which studies the diffusion of five types of social innovations in energy (inclusive mobility planning, energy autonomous islands, introducing car-free “superblocks” in cities, city quarter revitalization through energy effectivization, fighting fuel poverty through participatory energy efficiency plans). For this paper, first findings of the ongoing social network analyses in the social innovation cases are presented, outlining who key actors in such innovation cases are – again underlining the important function of communication, interaction and decision-making in groups. Two cases were selected (the Danish “Energy Island” Samsø and the Swedish eco-neighbourhood Augustenborg in Malmö). In both cases, it becomes obvious that successful social energy innovations require the collaboration of a complex network of actors sitting at key positions in the social networks. Long term restructuring of local societies requires individuals that have the ability to engage larger fractions of the diverse network of different actors. Across both projects, this paper makes a strong case for studying consumer-driven energy choices towards energy sufficiency and innovation from a social systems perspective, rather than a technological or overly individualistic perspective. © 2019 European Council for an Energy Efficient Economy.

2019,Generalized Building Energy Efficiency and New Energy Utilization,E3S Web of Conferences,"The development of human society is a non-stop gear, and the way we use energy is about the future. How to use resources reasonably and effectively is the pressure we face. The increase in population is the problem of resource allocation - insufficient inventory of traditional energy sources. Economic development is a double-sided blade, and ecological environmental protection is our focus. Research and development of new energy and renewable energy is a way to block dependence on traditional energy sources. It is the inevitable way for human beings to coexist harmoniously with ecology in the future. The development of the construction industry has also brought about a greater proportion of energy consumption. Building heating, ventilation, air conditioning and lighting account for about one-third of the total energy consumption. The carbon dioxide emissions of the construction industry account for more than half of the total emissions, which has a great impact on the environment. The broad definition of building energy conservation is proposed, and the significance of using new energy to building energy conservation is expanded from the perspective of macro environment, including the use of integrated energy, solar energy, and energy islands to achieve zero energy consumption in building energy conservation.

2019,Stakeholder consultation and nature inclusive design of the offshore grid,CIGRE Science and Engineering,"In this paper, TenneT will elaborate on the ideas related to offshore grid eco-design: cooperation with environmental organisations, the value of offshore data gathering, and the re-assessment of the offshore grid concept from a nature inclusive design perspective. For TenneT, since the start of the offshore grid development in 2013, the cooperation with external stakeholders like government, offshore wind sector and environmental organisations was key. Through several consultation sessions suggestions and requirements were gathered and applied during the design and (spatial) planning/licensing phase of the offshore grid concept. At the time (2014-2016), cost reduction was the leading factor. Amongst others, a cooperation with Rijkswaterstaat was initiated, to create the so-called Maritime Information Services Point for offshore data gathering. Services with a societal benefit are coordinated and data will become publicly available, e.g. meteo data and bird & bat monitoring. Since 2013, TenneT has gathered insights from several project specific Environmental Impact Assessments, resulting in requirements for the permits and licenses of the offshore grid projects. Based on the experiences so far, TenneT is now re-assessing the standardised offshore grid concept in terms of opportunities for nature enhancement and further ecological monitoring. Whereas cost reduction is still an important driver, additionally the idea of using the offshore grid infrastructure to realise opportunities to increase nature diversity and to achieve additional societal benefits has evolved. Nature inclusive design measures have been identified for the topside (bird deck), jacket (biocages) and along the cable route and within the safety zone of the platform (hard substrate structures). The expectation is that if such measures are integrated in an early stage, they can be added against very limited cost and risk compared to the project investment. The ultimate objective is to enhance nature inclusive design as an incremental part of the technical design and (spatial) planning/licensing phase of the offshore grid. © 2019, CIGRE.

2019,Synergy between smart energy systems simulation tools for greening small Mediterranean islands,Renewable Energy,"Several islands around the world are facing common challenges in terms of high energy costs, local CO2 emissions, security of supply and system stability. In EU, many islands have become sites of energy innovation, where betting on Renewable Energy Sources is a winning choice to meet their energy needs. In this framework, renewable energies play a key role for supporting the transition of small islands to an autonomous, cleaner and low-carbon energy system – in line with the overall EU Energy Union package and EU2030 goals. This study examines the suitability of using hybrid energy system comprising photovoltaic systems, wind turbines, biomass and diesel generators to meet the electricity demand of Favignana Island, to increase the penetration of renewables in the local electricity grid. Additionally, the energy scenarios simulation aimed at identifying foreseeable energy-environmentally improvements associated to the mutual merging of further energy sectors, such as transportation and heating sector. Consequently, the renewable capacity firming issues can be strongly mitigated by integrating new energy demand components. Thus, this work shows in a systemic overview all the outcomes related to the different energy mix layout, with varying the RES share values compatibly with the local grid electrotechnical constraints. Furthermore, this paper studies the impact that the introduction of electric vehicles into the island car fleet will have on the energy system. The smart energy system's components and sizes have been studied both from an energy and an economic point of view by means of two different software (i.e. EnergyPLAN and HOMER). © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
2020,The Insulating Properties of Polypropylene Blends Modified by ULDPE and Graphene for HVDC Cables,Polymer Insulation Applied for HVDC Transmission,"HVDC cable transmission plays an important role in urban center power supply, large-scale utilization of distributed energy, island and cross sea power transmission. Thermoplastic polypropylene (PP) material has excellent heat resistance and insulation performance, and can be recycled. However, it is not suitable to apply PP directly to the cable insulation for its low temperature impact and brittleness. In this chapter, polypropylene was blended with vinyl elastomer ULDPE to improve its mechanical toughness. The optimal proportion of PP/ULDPE blends was determined by the melting and crystallization behavior, mechanical tensile properties, trap distribution characteristics, space charge, conductivity and breakdown properties of the blends. Then, PP/ULDPE blends with different amount of nano graphene were prepared. The space charge, electrical conductivity and breakdown strength of PP and its nano graphene modified composites at different temperatures were measured and analyzed. Based on the isothermal discharge current method, the trap distribution characteristics of PP/ULDPE/graphene nanocomposites were obtained to study the relationship between space charge, electrical conductivity, breakdown strength and nano graphenen. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2021, corrected publication 2021."
2018,Storifying Samsø’s Renewable Energy Transition,Science as Culture,"Through a joint community effort Denmark’s Renewable Energy Island Samsø became self-sufficient with renewable energy over a period of 10 years from 1997 to 2007. Today, the story about Samsø’s successful energy transition has become a global export and a widely known model of community building, public participation and shared ownership in renewable energy technologies and transition processes. What has allowed the Samsø narrative to travel so widely has been the effective ‘transition story’ created about the islanders’ efforts. This transition story, however, has become fixed with the years and has assumed an ideal-typical character. Meanwhile, the challenges and costs inherent in the complicated socio-material process of transition are underestimated and largely forgotten. While such transition stories are indeed inspiring, the ideal-typical narrative may stand in the way of the development of further local energy transitions, as challenging elements of the process are downplayed to strengthen the narrative power of the story. Ethnographic stories about Samsø complicate the island’s transition narrative and add nuance to the Samsø story, highlighting its discrepancies and problematizing the effects of such well-crafted transition narratives. This tendency toward the ‘storification’ of transition processes is not restricted to Samsø; it is employed as a tactics by environmental organizations operating globally. © 2017 Process Press."
2018,North Seas Offshore Network (NSON): Challenges and its way forward,Journal of Physics: Conference Series,"Serving a twofold purpose, integrated offshore grids can facilitate the connection of offshore wind generation with onshore networks as well as the interconnection of asynchronous market areas for power trade. With a growing amount of offshore wind generation being deployed in Northern Europe, the relevance of a North Seas Offshore Network (NSON) increases, particularly in light of high cross-sectoral decarbonisation targets. To investigate future deployments of offshore grids in the North Seas, the national NSON project in Germany developed a closely linked modelling chain involving several stages: market- and technology-based grid planning, offshore grid validation, and onshore grid repercussions. Following an introduction to the NSON Initiative, a comprehensive overview of the modelling stages is given. Important subjects for further research which could be identified while working on the NSON-DE project are discussed afterwards. Main issues include flexibility and uncertainty in future energy systems, market integration, cost-benefit sharing, as well as robust grid planning and enhanced grid operation methods, especially for combined AC/DC-networks. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd."
2020,Effect of an Electric Vehicle Promotion Policy on China’s Islands: A Case Study of Hainan Island,Frontiers in Energy Research,"Despite the abundant clean energy resources on islands, energy supply on the islands in many countries and regions still depends on high-voltage power grids in neighboring continents and high-cost fossil energy such as oil. In China, increasing demand for private gasoline vehicles calls for an abundant gasoline supply, which is harmful to the renewable energy transformation on Chinese islands. The promotion of electric vehicles (EVs) offers a potential solution. However, on large islands with large populations, insufficient electricity supply restricts residents’ behavior, which has led to difficulties in promoting clean energy vehicles. To solve this problem, in 2019, the government formulated an 11-year plan to comprehensively promote clean energy vehicles from the energy supply side and user demand side to transform Hainan Island into a clean energy island. However, some predictions in the report are doubtful. As a result, this study takes Hainan Island in China as an example. Based on data on energy and EVs, the greenhouse gas emissions and electricity demand of the transportation industry in Hainan Island under policy and non-policy scenarios are calculated using a generation substitution accounting model. Based on the results, this study evaluates the expected effect of Hainan Province’s 11-year plan to develop clean energy vehicles and compares the results with those in the report. Policy implications based on the results are also proposed. This study combines the island’s energy structure with the application of EVs and expands the evaluation of government policies on the impact of large-scale energy transformation from the perspective of the energy supply chain. It also provides a reference for energy transformation on other large islands. © Copyright © 2020 Xiao, Chen, Wang and Nie."
2019,The integrated offshore grid in Europe: Exploring challenges for regional energy governance,Energy Research and Social Science,"The deployment of offshore wind and power transmission in the European North Sea is accelerating. Stakeholders advocate regional governance for the European grid expansion, which may evolve into a pan-European governance and is key to developing integrated, hybrid offshore projects. However, such projects are still scarce. We thus analyze the governance of the North Sea offshore grid expansion using the dimensions of level, implementation obligation, and implementation discretion. Our exploratory approach identifies five challenges. The challenges relate to 1) the interaction of the European and regional levels; 2) the interaction of the national and regional levels; 3) the participation of non-European Union countries; 4) the dependence of regional planning on national development plans, which consider national interests; and 5) the interaction of cost allocation and European financing for Projects of Common Interest. The recent Clean Energy Package proposal extensively reforms the regulation of the European power system. The Package is part of the Energy Union strategy and focuses on the energy and climate policies’ governance and the power system operation. Thus, regional governance of offshore expansion is largely unaltered, and our identified challenges remain unaddressed. © 2019 The Authors"
2021,Performance analysis of a novel hybrid power generation system integrated diesel generator with compressed heat energy storage,International Journal of Green Energy,"The time-dependent energy demand of energy islands may frequently change the operating condition of diesel generator (DG), leading to diesel engine operating under off-design conditions with low efficiency. In order to make the DG operate under efficient conditions and balance the mismatch of energy supply and demand in time, a novel hybrid power generation system integrated DG with compressed heat energy storage (CHEST) using sensible and latent thermal energy storage is proposed in this study. The overall efficiency of the proposed system could be further improved due to the waste heat recovery of exhaust and cooling water. Firstly, a parametric analysis of the CHEST unit is conducted to select optimal parameters and conditions for the CHEST unit. Then a comparative analysis between the traditional DG system and the proposed DG-CHEST coupling system with three operating strategies is carried out. Results indicate that Strategy A, B, and C could save fuel of 45.48 kg (17.74%), 44.22 kg (16.19%), and 38.89 kg (14.23%) a day, corresponding to the overall efficiency of 28.02%, 27.83%, and 26.22%, respectively, while it is only 20.89% for the conventional DG system. The comparative results among the three strategies show that the discharged power index (DPI) and discharged fraction (DF) decrease with the increase of control level of load factor. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
2020,Analytical Small-Signal Modelling of Diode-Rectifier based HVDC Link Based on Physical Switching Actions of Diodes,"2020 IEEE 21st Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics, COMPEL 2020","The diode-rectifier High-Voltage Direct-Current (HVDC) link provides a cost-effective energy transportation method for far-offshore wind farm. However, it relies on the grid-forming wind turbines to stabilize offshore grid. Herein, we establish an analytical small-signal model of diode-rectifier HVDC link, to provide theoretical bases for the offshore grid control. The proposed modeling approach utilizes the physical switching actions of diodes to relate the ac and dc variables of diode rectifier, which allows to fully preserve the dynamics of passive components at ac and dc sides, and meanwhile accurately captures frequency-coupling effects induced by the diodes' nonlinear switching actions. The accuracy of the proposed small- signal model is validated by the frequency scanning in the electromagnetic transient (EMT) time-domain simulation. © 2020 IEEE."
2019,Requirements for interconnection of HVDC links with DC-DC converters,IECON Proceedings (Industrial Electronics Conference),"The number of high voltage direct current (HVDC) links continue to increase over the years, most of them, for offshore applications or bulk power transmission over long distances. The present paper evaluates the possible development of a direct current (dc) grid in Europe given the present, and future, HVDC links. Eight potential cases for the interconnection between close links are suggested as starting scenario for a multiterminal network. The need of a dc-dc converter and its special requirements are evaluated in function of suggested interconnections. As an example, a case study is chosen to evaluate the behavior of an interconnection between line commutated converter (LCC) and voltage source converter (VSC) link using a front-to-front (F2F) isolated converter. © 2019 IEEE."
2020,Robust local controllers design for the AC grid voltage control of an offshore wind farm,IFAC-PapersOnLine,"In this paper we deal with the problem of voltage control of the AC grid in an offshore wind farm by means of several converters, all of them connected to the AC offshore grid at the Point of Common Coupling (PCC) through different transmission lines. We propose to control the voltage simultaneously by all the connected converters, i.e., we have multiple actuators with the same goal. However, the number of operative converters can change during the wind farm operation and dynamics changes. Thus, it is necessary to assure the stability of the whole system in all different scenarios. In order to achieve a global design and implementation strategy, we propose the use of same controller parameters for all converters. For this kind of wind farm topology, we address the design of controllers as an optimization problem where we seek to maximize the robustness against uncertainty in the model of transmission lines and changes in the number of connected wind turbines guaranteeing the stability of the whole system in all different scenarios as well as a given settling time. Due to the proposed design strategy it is not necessary communication between different converters and controllers do not need to be re-tuned when the number of connected converters changes. © 2020 The Authors.

2018,Comparative study of two control strategies of a Multiterminal VSC-HVDC systems,"2018 7th International Conference on Systems and Control, ICSC 2018","Voltage Source Converter High Voltage Direct Current (VSC-HVDC) is a hopeful technology for future smart grid and offshore applications. It can be used to feed weak networks and can be kept compact, which makes it more appropriated to build connections to offshore wind farms. The feasibility for such applications has been proven by projects all over the world. The development of renewable energies such as offshore wind energy as well as multiplication of HVDC links between the different countries of the Union European create the possibility to build a Multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) offshore grid which is superimposed on the existing HVAC network.This paper focused on HVDC transmission systems with three terminals considered as the most plausible projects in the future.

2020,Implications of carbon price paths on energy security in four Baltic region countries,Energy Strategy Reviews,"Energy security is one of the critical priorities of energy policy in the European Union and particularly in the Baltic region that is currently transforming itself from an isolated energy island to a highly interconnected area. In this paper, a comprehensive analysis of energy security in Estonia, Finland, Latvia, and Lithuania in the context of the energy transition is presented. The paper explores regional implications of two paths of carbon price (gradual and delayed carbon price increase). The analysis is performed by linking an energy system optimisation model with a probabilistic model of energy security. This modelling suite is used to assess the resilience of the planned energy system to possible disruptions. The results demonstrate that carbon price paths have a modest impact on energy security in Baltic countries if energy security measures are implemented in an optimal way. The research is based on the case study conducted in the framework of the European Union's Horizon 2020 project REEEM. © 2020"
2019,Study of harmonics created by a power flow controller in a meshed multi-terminal high voltage direct current grid,CIGRE Science and Engineering,"This paper is focused on the study of the harmonics generated by a power flow controller (PFC) in a meshed multi-terminal direct current (MTDC) grid. The main goals are to identify their importance and relation to the switching frequency of the PFC and to study the harmonic propagation throughout the grid. Simulations of a model with realistic offshore grid parameters are performed in MATLAB/Simulink. Results show that the amplitude of the harmonics created by the PFC in the MTDC grid varies in size depending on the PFC switching frequency and on the type of resonance between harmonics and the impedance-frequency response of the grid. Furthermore, the amplitude of the harmonics decreases along the cable. In the case study considered, it is necessary to choose the PFC switching frequency well and to include filtering at the PFC outputs to avoid high-amplitude harmonics. © 2019, CIGRE.

2020,Network and market-aware bidding to maximize local RES usage and minimize cost in energy Islands with weak grid connections,Energies,"The increasing renewable energy sources RES penetration in today’s energy islands and rural energy communities with weak grid connections is expected to incur severe distribution network stability problems (i.e., congestion, voltage issues). Tackling these problems is even more challenging since RES spillage minimization and energy cost minimization for the local energy community are set as major pre-requisites. In this paper, we consider a Microgrid Operator (MGO) that: (i) gradually decides the optimal mix of its RES and flexibility assets’ (FlexAsset) sizing, siting and operation, (ii) respects the physical distribution network constraints in high RES penetration contexts, and (iii) is able to bid strategically in the existing day-ahead energy market. We model this problem as a Stackelberg game, expressed as a Mathematical Problem with Equilibrium Constraints (MPEC), which is finally transformed into a tractable Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP). The performance evaluation results show that the MGO can lower its costs when bidding strategically, while the coordinated planning and scheduling of its FlexAssets result in higher RES utilization, as well as distribution network aware and cost-effective RES and FlexAsset operation. © 2020 by the authors.

2019,A supra-national TSO to enhance offshore wind power development in the Baltic Sea? A legal and regulatory analysis,Energy Policy,"Offshore wind power development is expected to play an important role in meeting the EU climate targets. To integrate offshore wind power, advanced offshore infrastructures such as meshed grids are suggested to optimise the grid development. Meshed offshore grids refer to integrated offshore infrastructure where offshore wind power hubs are interconnected to several countries as opposed to radial connection linking the wind farm to one single country and market. However, development of meshed architectures is hindered by the legal and regulatory barriers. Earlier research has identified the lack of cooperation and misalignments in national legal and regulatory frameworks as being the main risk factors in integrated offshore network investments. The purpose of this article is to investigate whether a supra-national TSO could facilitate regional cooperation and coordinated investments to develop meshed offshore grids. Several studies have discussed the case of North Seas, but the Baltic Sea region has had less attention despite the large offshore wind development potential. In this paper, a multi-disciplinary approach combining legal dogmatics and regulatory economics is used to identify the existing barriers and the possible solutions. The Baltic Sea countries are used as illustration. We suggest legal and regulatory recommendations that comply with the EU energy policy targets of sustainability, competition and reliability. © 2019 The Authors"
2019,Controlling strategies for meshed offshore DC collector grids,PCIM Europe Conference Proceedings,"The grid integration of future wind farms far away from the shore demands efficient energy transmission systems. Moreover, the growth of generator power leads to the need of transmission lines and grids with huge power transmission capacities. To establish reliable offshore grids with low losses, HVDC systems are proposed as a suitable solution. The direct coupling of wind turbine generator systems (WTGS) to a DC collector grid is considered to avoid offshore AC collector grids with large reactive losses. Meshes in the grid lead to the possibility of linking different offshore transmission lines on the one hand and, on the other hand, a meshed grid is more robust against disturbances within the grid or on single transmission lines. This paper presents centralised and decentralised methods to control a meshed DC collector grid and compares advantages and disadvantages by simulation. © VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach."
2019,Coordinated start-up control and inter-converter oscillations damping for MMC-HVDC Grid,IEEE Access,"Modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based high-voltage direct current (HVDC) grid is a promising technology for multiple offshore wind farms (OWFs) to form interconnected offshore grids. However, in the MMC-HVdc grid, the converter terminals connecting the OWFs could only be passively pre-charged by the ones connecting active ac networks via the dc lines during the start-up process. Under this condition, the start-up process of HVdc grid of the passive-side converters becomes significantly complicated. This paper, considering an HVdc grid integrating multiple passive-side converters, investigates its start-up process with three main contributions: 1) a modified nearest level modulation (NLM) method is proposed for the passive-side converters to mitigate the inrush currents after they are deblocked; 2) based on the dc-side equivalent models, the inter-converter resonances and oscillations between the passive-side converters are analyzed after they are deblocked, and; 3) an oscillation damping controller is proposed to provide the electrical damping of inter-converter oscillations between the passive-side converters. The simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC from a four-terminal MMC-HVDC grid with two terminals connecting the OWFs verify the effectiveness of the proposed start-up control schemes. © 2013 IEEE."
2019,Design and optimization of power hubs for Brazilian off-shore oil production units,Energy,"A worldwide trend to reduce greenhouse gases emissions has encouraged researchers to study more efficient solutions in oil and gas Industry. Most offshore units are energized by equipment operating at low loads, increasing environmental impact. This work aims identifying optimal designs and layouts of a combined cycle floating power hub tailored for offshore oil production applications. The Brazilian pre-salt basin which forecast high fuel gas production is taken as a case study. A model was developed, integrating the design of the gas turbine, heat recovery units, steam turbine and condenser. Genetic algorithms were applied in two optimization approaches, single-objective and multi-objective. Three parameters were evaluated: equipment purchase cost, thermal efficiency and total weight. The results of the multi-objective optimization indicated that dual-pressure arrangements, featuring 3 gas turbines, 1 heat recovery steam generator and 1 steam cycle, could be an attractive design solution for power hubs. This arrangement has a low cost and weight, while the thermal efficiency is maintained at a reasonably high level (around 53.2%). Moreover, results indicated that CO2 emissions may be reduced by 18.7%–27.2% at design point and 19% for the power hub lifetime, when compared with the conventional energy supply scenario. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"
2021,A review on energy storage and demand side management solutions in smart energy islands,Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews,"European Union has definitely identified the priorities towards sustainable and low-carbon energy systems recognizing a key role to islands that have been described as ideal sites to develop and test innovative strategies and solutions that will then boost the transition on the mainland. Nevertheless, the integration of Variable Renewable Energy Sources (vRES) into the electricity grid are already causing technical problems to island grids thus making grid flexibility a key topic. In the past, since power plants were completely manageable while the load was unpredictable, the grid flexibility was supplied by traditional power plants; but now, due to vRES, the variability and unpredictability has moved to the generation side and the opposite shift has happened to flexibility agents. This paper deals with solutions that improve the ability of the grid to cope with vRES unpredictability such as energy storage technologies and all the solutions offered by sector coupling strategies. Particularly, this research focus on solutions that deals with such solutions in the insular contexts. Several solutions have been presented concluding that battery energy systems and pumped hydro energy storage are the most used technologies in islands. As regard sector coupling and Demand Side Management solutions, all the analysed solutions showed relevant results in terms of i) reduction of excess electricity production and ii) increased grid ability of hosting vRES. Nevertheless, some of the current gaps in literature have been pinpointed and future research challenge and opportunities have been suggested. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd"
2020,North Sea region energy system towards 2050: Integrated offshore grid and sector coupling drive offshore wind power installations,Wind Energy Science,"This paper analyses several energy system scenarios towards 2050 for the North Sea region. With a focus on offshore wind power, the impacts of meshed offshore grid and sector coupling are studied. First, a project-based scenario, where each offshore wind power plant is connected individually to the onshore power system, is compared to a meshed grid scenario. Both the amount of offshore wind power installed and the level of curtailment are assessed. Then, these results are compared to a scenario with sector coupling included. The results show that while the introduction of a meshed grid can increase the amount of offshore wind power installed towards 2050, sector coupling is expected to be a more important driver for increasing offshore wind power installations. In addition, sector coupling can significantly decrease the level of offshore wind curtailment. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH. All rights reserved."
2020,Optimal management of the energy systems using a Pumping Hydro Energy Storage (PHES),"ECOS 2020 - Proceedings of the 33rd International Conference on Efficiency, Cost, Optimization, Simulation and Environmental Impact of Energy Systems","Small-scale energy systems like mini-grids and energy islands can rely on different power production technologies aimed at granting a reliable and efficient energy supply. The implementation of proper management strategies is fundamental to control their operations, reduce the operational costs, control the connection to the grid, as well as increase the overall system efficiency. In this work, a Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) algorithm has been developed to compute the optimal scheduling of generators and storage of energy systems and investigate how the latter affects the energy system efficiency. The algorithm has been tested on a case study constituted by four Internal Combustion Generators (ICGs) fed by different fuels and a Pumping Hydro Energy Storage (PHES) system, which equilibrates the energy production of the ICGs and limits their use. The algorithm calculates the optimal scheduling of the energy produced by the ICGs and the PHES, thus minimizing the total cost of the overall energy system considering two different cases. In the first case, the ICGs efficiency has been considered constant, in the second case, ICGs efficiency curves have been introduced to consider ICGs efficiency variabilities at partial load operations. Results show that the PHES system can play a key role to keep the ICGs operating near to their best efficiency point. © ECOS 2020.All right reserved."

E-LAND is a European project which concept is to develop a service bus application enabling energy islands to optimize the management of energy production and consumption, which focuses on communities of end-users' needs instead of addressing the system operators' requirements. In this new organization of the energy market, the risk ownership on devices and energy costs are shared by the energy islands, the grid owner and the energy supplier. To support the energy islands in their new role, the E-LAND final product must not add risk in the management of energy. Thereby, a risk assessment is performed to ensure that the concept, the solution, and the application to be delivered in E-LAND are safe, secure, and reliable. This paper describes the project risk management for the E-LAND project and gives examples of future potential users, best practices on how to access, communicate and manage project risks with multi-disciplinary and international partners.

2018,Harmonic stability of VSC connected Low Frequency AC offshore transmission with long HVAC cables,Electric Power Systems Research,Low Frequency AC (LFAC) transmission has been proposed as an alternative to HVDC transmission for the integration of offshore wind. The LFAC offshore grid as a fully power electronic grid with a long HVAC cable provides significant challenges to harmonic stability. This paper presents an impedance based stability analysis to determine the stability of the power electronic offshore system across the harmonic frequency range. The stability analysis is introduced and applied to the LFAC system. The impact of different current and voltage control bandwidths and component sizes on the dynamic impedance of the converters is then examined and their impact on harmonic stability of the LFAC grid is determined. It is found that detailed knowledge of the control parameters and the ability to tune the bandwidths can mitigate significant harmonic instability with the presence of a long HVAC cable. Three phase simulations are then used to validated the impedance based stability technique. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

This demands more temporal- and spatial flexibility in the system, an adequate grid infrastructure can provide both. This study presents an engineering-economic approach evaluating the impact of novel infrastructure designs towards a fully integrated North Sea offshore grid, including TenneT’s vision of a power link island (PLI). A PLI is an artificial island for transnational power exchange and distribution of offshore wind resources. We introduce the concept and evaluate the economic benefits and system implications under three different case studies incorporating 2030 scenarios from European Network of Transmission System Operators. The results demonstrate system cost savings up to 15.8% when comparing a fully integrated PLI solution with traditional, radial typologies. The PLI did in general result in more efficient system dispatch of wind resources, where the involvement from Norway, Great Britain, and Germany occurred most frequently in terms of grid reinforcements and expansions.

Many of the offshore wind farms have a considerable distance to shore. Large-scale HVDC converters connect wind farm clusters to the public grid. The synthetic offshore AC grid, with its inherent properties, provides a number of challenges for the wind farm operators. One of the main risks for them is the quality of the grid connection provided by the transmission system operator.

2020,Frequency behavior of an MMC test bench system,"6th IEEE International Energy Conference, ENERGYCon 2020",Interactions of modular multi-level converters (MMCs) compromising the system stability can be assessed by investigating the frequency behavior of the converter. The MMC Test Bench system replicates full-scale converters on a low-voltage level. It can emulate high-voltage direct current systems representing meshed offshore grids as well as the influence of wind farms connected to MMCs. Measuring the MMC Test Bench's frequency behavior allows for assessing the frequency behavior of the applied control systems by avoiding simplifications of the electrical part of the MMC. This paper presents a setup for measuring the frequency-dependent impedance of the laboratory MMCs. The impedance is compared to small-scale as well as full-scale converter models. It is shown that the measured impedance can be scaled up for full-scale HVDC studies by means of derived correction factors. The results further demonstrate that simplified time-domain models can represent the MMC Test Bench but fail to represent the exact frequency behavior at low and high frequencies. © 2020 IEEE.
2019,Research on overcurrent suppression strategy of true bipolar MMC-HVDC single pole blocking bridge arm,IET Conference Publications,"Due to the characteristics of Vf control in the islanding flexible dc power grid, when the single-pole latching fault occurs at the sending end of the dc power grid, the converter station connected to the new energy island system cannot control the ac voltage and the incoming new energy power at the same time. A healthy pole converter is forced to transfer the active power of the faulty pole converter, which results in the over-current blocking of the healthy pole converter. In this paper, by describing the dynamic process of the bridge arm current when the single-pole locking fault occurs, the mechanism of the over-current is studied, and a new type of additional control is proposed to suppress the magnitude of the over-current of the bridge arm by controlling the dc voltage. Finally, PSCAD/EMTDC simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the theoretical analysis and control strategy. © 2019 Institution of Engineering and Technology. All rights reserved."
2019,Regional coordination in grid expansion with offshore wind: The case of the baltic sea region,"International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM","The development of offshore wind in the Baltic Sea Region is expected to contribute to the renewable energy capacity, consequently leading to an expansion of the offshore and onshore grid among the countries in the region. The establishment of new hybrid architectures such as meshed offshore grids, directly connecting offshore wind farms to interconnectors, potentially contributes to taking full advantage of future grid expansions. However, the fact that each country designed their power systems decades ago when regional coordination was not in focus, can potentially destabilise joint efforts if the benefit of the new hybrid infrastructure is not represented also at a national level. In this paper we assess the impact of wind development in the region in a radial vs. hybrid scenario depending on the budget available for the expansion. Furthermore, we identify the specific challenges relative to investment cost distribution and analyse several regulatory frameworks that mitigate the ripple effect of the investment decisions of each country. Finally, we formulate policy recommendations to overcome the investment barrier and suplport coordination in joint regional grid investment. © 2019 IEEE."
2018,Analysing economic and environmental sustainability related to the use of battery and hydrogen energy storages for increasing the energy independence of small islands,Energy Conversion and Management,"Energy costs, carbon dioxide emissions, security of supply and system stability are common challenges in small islands. Many European islands have become pilot sites of energy innovation, but this green transition goes slowly in other ones usually not connected to the national grid. This study investigates the economic and environmental sustainability related to the integration of hydrogen and batteries storage in small islands, considering at the same time the use of the stored hydrogen for fuelling Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles and Hydrogen Compressed Natural Gas vehicles to meet electricity and public transportation demand of islands, so as to increase the Renewable Energy Sources penetration level. Selecting the island of Favignana (Italy) as case study, HOMER software has been used to carry out the energy analysis of different scenarios, in order to identify the most effective energy solution from both technological and economical point of views. Using economic and environmental indicators, the outcomes show that the implementation of a hybrid storage system with batteries and electrolyser can be an adequate and reliable option for increasing energy independency of small island and decarbonizing transport sector optimizing economic and environmental sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"
2018,The mid atlantic current hindcast Mach,"Offshore Technology Conference Asia 2018, OTCA 2018","The objective was the generation of a long-term layered ocean current dataset for the central and southern Atlantic Ocean, of suitable quality to support deep water offshore engineering design, marine operational planning and oil spill simulation. A model scheme was formulated to provide a reference fine resolution offshore grid covering the Atlantic Ocean from 30 degrees north to the Antarctic land mass. Very fine resolution grids were nested to model the continental shelf and slope regions of principal interest for oil and gas exploration and production. Various schemes were evaluated for representation of the riverine discharge, which is of major importance in some parts of west Africa. Additionally, optimal data assimilation scheme formulation was considered in order to best represent ocean surface topography, registration of major dynamic features such as fronts and eddies, and also correct characterisation of ocean density structure. Particular attention has been given to the equatorial region where energetic Kelvin wave propagation is generated by wind forcing; such waves contribute significantly to the most severe ocean current speeds, but can be spuriously misrepresented by inappropriate assimilation of erroneous observational data. The computational runtime required to undertake a long-term ocean reanalysis was large, even when using a major supercomputing facility. Therefore, it was extremely important to ensure that the model configuration was optimised in a structured pilot evaluation in advance of the full production run in order to achieve 'fitness for purpose' for the intended applications of the resultant dataset. This paper discusses the detailed process of structured model optimisation, where various permutations of setup had been validated against available in-situ measurements. The final model has now been completed for a 20year run and has been used in a number of regional metocean studies for Oil and Gas clients. The inclusion of location specific processes offers significant advantages over previously existing models. © 2018, Offshore Technology Conference."
2019,Economical evaluation of an isolated AC offshore grid for pre-salt oil production based on power hub for reducing carbon emissions,"8th International Conference on Renewable Energy Research and Applications, ICRERA 2019","Oil and gas will still play a major role in supplying the global energy demand for the foreseeable future. Their extraction is an energy intensive sector with high level of associated greenhouse gas emissions. To address climate change concern and a carbon constrained economy, alternatives must be sought to drive the projects to new directions. For ultra-deep waters offshore activities like the ones being developed at the Brazilian pre-salt basin, located 200 km away from the coast in waters with 2,000 m depth, mature alternatives as the power from shore pose a significant engineering challenge. One alternative that can avoid weight and space restrictions on the offshore environment is the power hub. A power hub consists of a more efficient central power plant to feed partially or in total a number of offshore platforms. This paper aims at complementing previous results found in the technical literature to provide useful information for oil companies to make a full informed decisions on the adoption of a power hub. A step-by-step procedure is provided for the dimensioning and the cost estimation of such isolated AC offshore grids resulting from the power hub concept adoption. Results show that the submarine power cables are responsible for the majority of the investment and the lower cost was achieved using 66 kV for the transmission system, among the analyzed options. © 2019 IEEE."
2017,Performance Analysis of a Medium Frequency Offshore Grid for Identification of Vessels Sailing on High Density Maritime European Routes,Polish Maritime Research,"The paper analyses the performance of an Automatic Vessel Identification System on Medium Frequency (AVISOMEF), which works with the Grid Method (GM) on high density maritime European routes using real data and uniformly distributed data. Compared to other systems, AVISOMEF is a novelty, as it is not a satellite system, nor is it limited by a given coverage distance, in contrast to the Automatic Identification System (AIS), though in exceptional circumstances it leans towards it. To perform the analysis, special simulation software was developed. Moreover, a number of maritime routes along with their traffic density data were selected for the study. For each route, two simulations were performed, the first of which based on the uniform traffic distribution along the route, while the second one made use of real AIS data positioning of vessels sailing on the selected routes. The obtained results for both simulations made the basis for formulating conclusions regarding the capacity of selected routes to support AVISOMEF."
2020,Optimal planning of a 100% renewable energy island supply system based on the integration of a concentrating solar power plant and desalination units,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,"Environmental-unfriendly power supply mode and freshwater shortage are two main problems for isolated islands. A 100% renewable energy supply system equipped with local desalination units is an effective solution to the above problems. It can save fuel supplies and eliminate pollutant emissions. Firstly, a 100% renewable energy supply system based on wind turbines and the integration of a concentrating solar power (CSP) plant and desalination units is proposed in this paper. The flexible schedulability of CSP plants is utilized to complement to wind power generation, and the thermal storage system reduces the battery energy storage configuration for islands. Different from the conventional method of seeking the minimum levelized cost of CSP from limited capacity combinations, an optimal planning model is established to achieve the minimum overall costs of the 100% renewable energy system. In addition, the adjustable output characteristic of CSP is also considered as the decision variables to optimize the operation of the microgrid. The model is linearized to a mixed integer linear programming problem. Simulation results show that the proposed supply system improves the efficiency of renewable energy utilization and capacity factors of generation units; the peak load demand is cut down and the capacity configuration of generation units is also reduced. The comparison with other state-of-art systems shows that the cost-effectiveness of the proposed system is better in areas with abundant renewable energy resources and high fuel costs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd"

2019,Alternative control approach for the offshore grid of wind power plants,Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Decision and Control,"This paper describes the problem of control of the electric grid of offshore wind farms that pour their power to the onshore electrical network through a high voltage direct current link based on modular multilevel converters. Nowadays, it is solved in a similar way as would be done in conventional electrical networks, in which the frequency is a variable that must be controlled by conventional generators with great inertia. However, due to the use of power electronics converters in this kind of electrical networks, a new strategy is proposed in which frequency ceases to be a degree of freedom and it is shown that in this way, the system to be controlled is linear. With this proposal, it is possible to develop more robust controllers and achieve a better performance of wind farms. © 2019 IEEE."
2020,Offshore Grid Development as a Particular Case of TEP,Transmission Expansion Planning: The Network Challenges of the Energy Transition,"Offshore grids transmission lines of different technologies interconnect onshore power systems and connect offshore wind farms to shore. In an integrated offshore grid, some transmission lines realize both functions simultaneously. Integrated offshore grids may provide additional socio-economic benefits, including non-monetary ones such as innovation, industrial development, reduced environmental impacts and improved cooperation between countries. However, an integrated grid may entail additional costs to a non-integrated one, and several risks may lead to suboptimal offshore expansion planning. Nonetheless, research and cooperation between actors to develop such grids in Europe, Asia and North America is advancing. This chapter surveys the challenges to the expansion planning of offshore grid, structured in the building blocks of governance, planning, ownership, pricing and finance, and operation.

2020,Investing in meshed offshore grids in the baltic sea: Catching up with the regulatory gap,International Journal of Sustainable Energy Planning and Management,"The connection of cables from offshore wind parks to interconnection lines is receiving growing attention in Europe. Although important technical breakthroughs are enabling transmission system operators (TSOs) to engage in such hybrid forms of architecture, substantial regulatory challenges are preventing progress. Anchored in current European legal frameworks and targets, this paper reviews the national framework conditions that treat the development of transmission grids as regulated assets, focusing on the distribution of connection costs, the access grid tariff and the investment incentives faced by TSOs. The paper develops an ideal regulatory framework and compares it to the current regulations in countries around the Baltic Sea in order to assess their suitability for supporting Meshed Offshore Grids (MOGs). The results of this paper highlight the heterogeneity of national regulatory frameworks and the deviations from our recommendations. It is found that Germany lives up to the recommendations best, followed by Denmark, which suggests they have the regulatory potential to pioneer a MOG project in the Baltic Sea region. This is followed by consideration of two clusters of countries defined by their proximity to the ideal framework, assuming a three-step development of MOGs, and following ever more progressive regulatory adjustments. © 2020, Aalborg University press.

2019,Active and reactive power control of hybrid offshore AC and DC grids,Automatika,"The future ‘SuperGrid’ may requires the benefit of both offshore AC network and multi-terminal DC grid. AC cable limits the power transfer capability from the larger offshore wind farm, however, HVDC transmission system is economical viable for large power wind farm integration with the grid. Another approach to develop the offshore network infrastructure is by forming an offshore AC grid connecting several offshore wind farms. Then, this offshore AC network is connected with different onshore grid using HVDC system. This enhances the trade among the countries as well as provide an economical solution for wind energy integration. In this article, operational and control concept of voltage source converter is presented to integrate an offshore AC grid with an offshore DC grid. The article presents the control principle of offshore AC network frequency and voltage with respect to active and reactive power distribution in the AC network. Later, the principle of multi-terminal HVDC system is discussed with respect to power distribution using DC voltage droop control. Power distribution criteria are defined with respect to operator power-sharing requirement and network stability.

2019,Energy Cooperation Ukraine-Poland to Strengthen Energy Security,E3S Web of Conferences,"The article analyzes the prospects of cooperation between Poland and Ukraine in the field of electric power transmission. In particular, the characteristics of the «Burshtyn Energy Island» are enlightened, which includes Burshtyn TPP, Kalush CHPP and Tereble-Ritsk HPP that are detached from the power system of Ukraine and operate in parallel with the European system ENTSO-E. This island serves as an importer of Ukrainian electric power to European countries through Hungary and Slovakia, respectively, and is synchronized with the European Network of System Operators for Electricity Transmission (ENTSO-E). The main problem of the international transmission of electric current of Ukraine is determined, which is that the whole energy system of Ukraine works within the international energy union of the CIS and Baltic IPS/UPS. At the same time, the integration of Ukraine into the markets of Western European countries requires the break of established connections under the IPS/UPS system and the parallel increase of communications under the ENTSO-E system through Poland, Slovakia, Romania and Hungary. The prospect for the development of the Energy Bridge project, which provides the supply of electric power from the Khmelnitsk NPP to Poland through the Khmelnitsk NPP-Rzeszow, is described.

2018,On-Site Acceptance and Diagnostic Testing of Submarine Inter-Array Cables at Offshore Wind Farms using Damped AC,ICHVE 2018 - 2018 IEEE International Conference on High Voltage Engineering and Application,"Systematic testing and diagnosis during manufacturing, transportation, installation and operation can exclude or at least reduce possible risks of a failure during operation. The 33 kV offshore grid has been the standard to date, but slowly the 66 kV offshore grid will be used as the standard. Along with this development, the voltage class of the inter-array cables will change. Considering the enhanced risks by using 66 kV cable systems, advanced quality control is becoming very important. The main challenge will be the need for specialized teams for installation and advanced testing activities, where they will need to be properly certified to work at a higher voltage level. Internationally, the testing after-installation protocol is still under consideration. The current state of the international standards is based on onshore experiences and therefore operationally problematic to cover the actual serious problems experienced with failures on 33 kV inter-array cables. In this contribution the testing experiences of inter-array cables at offshore wind farms will be presented. The application of damped AC in this concern is specially discussed in combination with actual testing examples that show the findings on inter-array cables at offshore wind farms. © 2018 IEEE."
2018,Short circuit analysis of an offshore AC network having multiple grid forming VSC-HVDC links,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,"This article presents the short circuit analysis of an offshore AC network which consists of wind power plants interconnected using HVAC cables. The power generated in the offshore AC network is transmitted to several onshore grids using VSC-HVDC system. The offshore AC network is formed by the VSC-HVDC systems using frequency and voltage droop control. A coordinated control scheme is proposed for wind turbines and offshore VSCs during short circuit conditions in the offshore grid to ensure fault ride through (FRT) without compromising the system stability. The theoretical analysis used for developing this control scheme allows to calculate the system limits taking into consideration the active and reactive power capability. In order to verify the proposed control scheme, three phase symmetric faults have been applied on a wind turbine busbar, HVAC busbar, and at the AC cable that interconnects the VSC-HVDC system. Additionally, a frequency coordination control scheme without communication between wind power generation and VSC-HVDC system has been proposed. The methodology and control system have been validated by performing a nonlinear simulation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd"

The adaptability of the renewable energy to the VSC-HVDC grid will become an important factor affecting the operation of the grid.

Breakthroughs have been made in the impact of AC/DC system interconnection and key equipment technologies for VSC-HVDC transmission systems, especially VSC-HVDC converters and control protection technology. This paper focuses on the two main problems with renewable energy island integration. The first problem is how the VSC-HVDC grid provides a stable AC voltage to the renewable energy source without AC grid support. The second issue is how to maintain the energy balance of the VSC-HVDC system in the event of a fault. When the receiving end fails, the power energy cannot be sent out. When the sending end fails, the energy will accumulate in the VSC-HVDC grid.

2020,Multi-objective optimization operation of the green energy island based on Hammersley sequence sampling,Energy Conversion and Management,"The Green Energy Island (GEI) is a system that supplies heating, cooling and electricity energy. This system includes various supply-side technologies, which introduces a large amount of degrees of freedom in the design and operation phases. Therefore, the optimal operation parameters should be determined to ensure continuous and stable heating, cooling and power supply of the GEI system. In this paper, the ε-constraints method based on Hammersley sequence sampling (HSS) method is proposed. Comparison with the traditional ε-constraints method shows that the ε-constraints method based on HSS method can save a lot of time in solving the multi-objective optimization problem. Moreover, an innovative multi-objective optimization framework that integrates the ε-constraints method, HSS method and TOPSIS approach is established in economic, energy and environmental benefit. Through the optimization calculation for three typical days, the approximate Pareto frontiers with possible operation parameters were presented, which provided a reference for decision makers. Finally, by using TOPSIS approach, the optimal energy dispatch was obtained for three typical days. The results show that the energy and environmental benefit of the GEI system is significant with the approximate 5–35% of the fuel energy saving ratio and the approximate 10–65% of carbon dioxide emission reduction ratio. © 2019"
2020,Diode Rectifier Unit Based LFAC Transmission for Offshore Wind Farm Integration; [基于二极管不控整流单元的远海风电低频交流送出方案],Zhongguo Dianli/Electric Power,"The offshore wind power, which is high in density and small in fluctuation, will be the focus for wind power development in the future. Up to now, the offshore wind power transmission projects in operation have mostly adopted VSC-HVDC technology, whereas their capital cost is relatively high. So, this paper proposes a diode uncontrolled unit (DRU) based low frequency alternative current (LFAC) transmission scheme for the offshore wind farms, in which the offshore platform of the rectifier is cancelled and the rectifier in the traditional AC-DC-AC frequency converter is substituted by the DRU, thus significantly reducing the project investment and operating cost. Since the DRU is uncontrolled, a corresponding control strategy of the offshore wind turbines is proposed for LFAC transmission system, in which the machine side converter (MSC) controls the DC voltage and the grid side converter (GSC) implements the maximum power point tracking (MPPT) and AC voltage control together in the global unified reference coordinate system.

2017,Criterion for the Electrical Resonance Stability of Offshore Wind Power Plants Connected Through HVDC Links,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,"Electrical resonances may compromise the stability of HVDC-connected offshore wind power plants (OWPPs). In particular, an offshore HVDC converter can reduce the damping of an OWPP at low-frequency series resonances, leading to the system instability. The interaction between offshore HVDC converter control and electrical resonances of offshore grids is analyzed in this paper. An impedance-based representation of an OWPP is used to analyze the effect that offshore converters have on the resonant frequency of the offshore grid and on system stability. The positive-net-damping criterion, originally proposed for subsynchronous analysis, has been adapted to determine the stability of the HVDC-connected OWPP. The reformulated criterion enables the net damping of the electrical series resonance to be evaluated and establishes a clear relationship between electrical resonances of the HVDC-connected OWPPs and stability. The criterion is theoretically justified, with analytical expressions for low-frequency series resonances being obtained and stability conditions defined based on the total damping of the OWPP. Examples are used to show the influence that HVDC converter control parameters and the OWPP configuration have on stability. A root locus analysis and time-domain simulations in PSCAD/EMTDC are presented to verify the stability conditions. © 2012 IEEE."

Italian Economic Development Minister Ivan Scalfarotto said that facilities off the Adriatic coast could be reused for wind and solar energy, or for monitoring the marine environment, seismic, tourism or wireless transmission. Liv Hovem, senior vice president Africa and Europe, DNV GL Oil & Gas at OMC, said that by taking various measures, oil and gas firms could reduce their CO2 footprints cost effectively, on average, by 29%. DNV GL has produced a tool to assess the opportunities, using what it calls a marginal abatement curve (MAC). This considers the cost per ton of CO2 of a measure and the overall CO2 emission reduction. One option is to use floating wind turbines to power subsea facilities, such as subsea water injection, specifically. DNV GL completed a feasibility study, with input from ExxonMobil, Eni and Statoil, on such a concept, based on a site in the North Sea. DNV GL targeted a 44,000 b/d concept, which would traditionally require a 3MW gas turbine on a platform.

2017,Reactive power management in an offshore AC network having multiple voltage source converters,Applied Energy,"Many offshore wind power plants are being developed every year at North and Baltic Sea. From the prospective of environment and integrated European power, combined power transmission from several offshore wind power plants using VSC-HVDC transmission system to different onshore grids are suitable instead of connecting each wind power plants individually. Offshore AC hub is beneficial for the wind power plants that are far from shore but close to each other within the vicinity of 20 km. This paper presents a method of controlling reactive power flow in the offshore AC grid to minimize the power losses and voltage deviation. In the proposed scheme, offshore grid frequency and voltage are controlled through more than one converter. Using frequency and voltage droop schemes, the active and reactive power sharing is achieved among converters. Furthermore, the optimization algorithm is developed to acquire the set points for the wind power plants and VSC-HVDC droop gains for the optimum operation of the network. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2014,Impact of Multi-Terminal HVDC grids on AC system stability and operation,CIGRE Session 45 - 45th International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2014,"During the last years, several plans for offshore grid development in Europe have been under discussion as a result of the need for the integration of large amounts of offshore wind power, providing additional transmission capacity and building adequate conditions for the single European electricity market. From the system operation viewpoint, technical constraints justify the need for adopting High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) technology with Voltage Source Converters (VSC) for offshore grid development rather than conventional AC connections. Additionally, reliability and flexibility of operation is pushing for the development of the Multi-Terminal DC (MTDC) grid concept, by which a set of offshore wind farms is connected to a set of onshore AC nodes via a (possibly meshed) DC grid structure. This concept is in line with the envisioned plans for the development of the pan-European Transmission System. A broad range of aspects related to MTDC grids planning, operation, and technology was dealt within the TWENTIES European research project (2009-2013). In particular, this paper presents some results regarding the impact of MTDC systems on the AC systems they are connected to: specific focus is devoted to provision of advanced ancillary services (primary frequency controls, Fault Ride Through capability to AC faults, reactive power support), to the possible contribution of the MTDC grid in enhancing the operational security of AC systems and in restarting them after partial or complete blackouts. To emphasize the advanced functionalities that can be provided for overall system operation, this MTDC grid is referred to in the paper as ""DC Grid"" (DCG). Simulation results illustrate the potential benefits for the AC systems deriving from the described advanced control functionalities of DCGs.

2017,Offshore wind farm harmonic resonance analysis - Part I: Converter harmonic model,"2017 IEEE Manchester PowerTech, Powertech 2017","Offshore wind power technology has matured significantly and now directly competes with conventional and onshore wind power generation. Thanks to continuous technological developments and significant cost reduction, offshore wind power is closing the gap with the onshore wind power about the levelized cost of electricity; however the technology challenges in the offshore environment still poses threats to the long-term operational reliability and profitability of offshore wind farm projects. This article focuses on one such threat: harmonic resonance in the offshore grid and presents an analytical solution to identify and mitigate it by applying advanced harmonic modelling of an offshore wind turbine. The analytical derivation of the frequency dependent positive and negative sequence impedance of a converter harmonic model of a 8MW generic wind turbine is presented. It concludes by comparing the frequency domain converter harmonic model of a generic 8MW offshore wind turbine with its time domain counterpart as well as the ideal current source model (conventional solution) under the distorted grid condition. The results obtained confirm that the converter harmonic model demonstrates superior accuracy when compared to the ideal current source model (conventional solution) for low order harmonics resonance interaction assessment. To conclude, the discrepancies in the results obtained from the time domain and the frequency domain models respectively deserves further investigation. Particularly the frequency dependent impedance as derived from the average model of the associated power electronics should be examined in detail as its validity depends strongly on the phenomena one is interested in (typically the average model provides sufficient accuracy when the frequency of interest under investigation is ten times smaller than the switching frequency). © 2017 IEEE."
2015,A perspective on the potential role of renewable gas in a smart energy island system,Renewable Energy,This paper examines the potential role for Power to Gas (P2G) as applied to an island energy system with high levels of renewable electricity penetration. P2G systems require both a supply of green electricity and a source of CO2. Cheap electricity is essential for a financially sustainable P2G system. Using a PLEXOS model it was determined that deploying 50MWe of P2G capacity on the 2030 Irish electrical grid may reduce absolute levels of curtailed wind by 5% compared to the base case. CO2 capture is expensive. The cheapest method of sourcing CO2 for a P2G system is to employ a methanation process whereby biogas from anaerobic digestion is mixed with hydrogen from surplus electricity. Anaerobic digestion in Ireland has a potential to produce biomethane to a level of 10.2% of energy in transport (19.2PJ/a). The potential CO2 resource from anaerobic digestion could allow for a further 8.9% of energy in transport (16.6PJ/a) from P2G production. An optimal model is proposed including for co-location of a biogas system with a P2G system. The model includes for demand-driven biogas concepts allowing electrical grid balancing and the supply of gaseous transportation fuel. Biofuel obligation certificates allows for a financially viable industry. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.

Based on these result, the energy potential in target area is clarified, and the feasibility of Zero Energy Island (ZEI) is evaluated. As a result, the following were revealed. 1) In the target island, solar energy has high potential due to mild climate with many sunny days. 2) Comparing biomass energy, potential of the pruned branches is higher because of vast orchard. 3) The potential of renewable energy exceed the energy demands by combining the four types of energy in the target island.

2016,Multi-parameter approach for the selection of preferred offshore power grids for wind energy,"2016 IEEE International Energy Conference, ENERGYCON 2016","Western Europe is heavily investing in offshore wind power, but the costs of these wind farms remain high. For that reason, current transmission grids for offshore wind energy are predominately radial to reduce investment cost. To date, selection approaches of offshore grid configurations are mainly based on the level of reliability. This paper introduces an alternative selection approach to comprehensively assess the net present value (NPV) of near-shore power grids. The assessment encompasses, among others, a load flow analysis, as well as the sensitivities to parameters like failure rates, repair times and energy prices, for different grid configurations (i.e. radial/ meshed). A case study of the Dutch offshore transmission system shows that this approach helps in finding a suitable tradeoff between lowest feasible NPV, while also improving the reliability (in terms of reduced lost energy) of the offshore grid. © 2016 IEEE."
2016,Drivers for the development of HVDC grids,HVDC Grids for Transmission of Electrical Energy: Offshore Grids and a Future Supergrid,"This chapter describes the evolution and the drivers in energy policy, resulting in a strong move towards the development of the offshore grid and super grid. As the perceived drive is strongest in Europe, the main focus is on the evolutions there. The specific drivers for high-voltage DC (HVDC) grids are the liberalization of the energy sector and the increase of renewable generation in the energy mix. With respect to the applicability for grid investments, the power-flow-controlling devices are being categorized into two types: flexible AC transmission systems (FACTSs) including phase-shifting transformers (PST) and high-voltage DC (HVDC) solutions. HVDC transmission systems transmit electric power at zero frequency and use power electronic converters to interface between the AC grid and the DC grid. HVDC offers an inherent active power control, making it more flexible in use and easier to limit overloads in the system. © 2016 by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

2017,Understanding the Origin of Oscillatory Phenomena Observed between Wind Farms and HVdc Systems,IEEE Journal of Emerging and Selected Topics in Power Electronics,"Field experience has shown that subsynchronous oscillation and harmonic resonance can occur between wind farms (WFs) and high voltage dc (HVdc) systems. The oscillations can appear in the presence of background harmonics due to the interaction between the wind energy conversion system's (WECS's) converter controller, HVdc converter controller, and the impact of the interconnection system impedance. However, the root causes of these oscillations observed in the field are not entirely understood and they can be attributed to various sources within the components and controllers of the interconnected system. This paper explores the possible causes of these oscillations by investigating the impact of controllers and components in the WF and in the voltage-source converter (VSC)-based HVdc transmission system. In order to understand this phenomenon, the impedance of both the WF and the HVdc from the offshore ac collection point is analytically derived to identify potential resonance points. The impedance frequency responses of the WF and the HVdc converter indicate the potential resonance at low frequency. The origin of these oscillations can be attributed to the propagation of the WECS resonance through the WECS full converter dc link and the interaction between the WECS and the HVdc system. Once the source and the load impedance are identified, an impedance-based stability method is adopted in order to determine the stability. In an attempt to improve the oscillatory phenomena, an active damping scheme is implemented on the offshore HVdc rectifier. An analysis and time-domain simulation results with its respective harmonic spectra show that the implemented active damping is very effective in eliminating the oscillations observed in the interconnected system. Moreover, this paper presents the role of the ratio between the bandwidths of the interconnected areas, as having an essential role in the root cause of the instability. The general rule is observed that when the bandwidth of the HVdc rectifier (which is the source) is faster than the bandwidth of the load (WFs inverter); the system operates stably. © 2013 IEEE."
2014,Regional cooperation potentials in the European context: Survey and case study evidence from the Alpine Region,Economics of Energy and Environmental Policy,"The energiewende (""Energy Turnaround"") in Germany will occur within the context of setting up Europe's internal electricity market. An important initial step will be to intensify regional cooperation between neighboring countries. We assert that the full benefits of regional cooperation will be realized by integrating Europe's market segments, e.g., real-time, day ahead, reserve markets and backup capacities, and coordinating grid expansion. This paper examines three existing regional schemes, the Pentalateral Forum, the North Sea Countries Offshore Grid Initiative and the Baltic Energy Market Interconnection Plan. The results of two case studies of the Alpine Region comprising Austria, France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland indicate that cross-border cooperation is possible even when involving only the operation of existing assets, and that the necessary capital-intensive investments in generation, renewables and transmission will be major challenges, but also potentially benefit the participating countries. We conclude that expanded regional cooperation is an essential element of Europe's decarbonization initiative and Germany's energiewende. Copyright © 2014 by the IAEE. All rights reserved."
2014,Systematic retrofit design methodology for evaluation of integratedforest biorefinery strategies,J-FOR,"North American forest product companies are considering the transformation of their businesses by integrating biorefineries into their existing pulp and paper facilities. However, not all biorefinery strategies are sustainable, and all do not imply the same level of risk. To assess biorefinery strategies, it is essential first to identify potential integrations between biorefinery candidates and the existing mill, and then to evaluate the cost synergies associated with these potential integrations. This article describes this approach as a retrofit design methodology. Considering the unique characteristics of the Kraft pulp mill under study, four biorefinery technologies were identified as potential transformation strategies. The main cost savings were found to be associated with integration potential at the energy island and the wastewater treatment unit. The results of retrofit design as used for economic analysis in this study can then be used to analyze the candidate biorefinery strategies further in terms of their sustainability performance."
2015,Nordic hydropower flexibility and transmission expansion to support integration of North European wind power,Wind Energy,"The expected increase of wind power production in the North and Baltic Seas will substantially increase the variability of the generation portfolio in Northern Europe. Access to available resources of flexible power production will be necessary to support the power system against this variability. Since the Nordic hydro-based power system can provide such resources, a stronger interconnection between continental Europe and the Nordic region seems to be beneficial. This paper assesses the challenges related to wind power production variability, especially offshore, in the North and Baltic Seas. Assessment on the transmission grid needed for both harvesting the available wind production located far away from load centres and to enable the optimal use of hydropower flexibility is studied in a long-term cost-benefit analysis. Special focus is devoted to the role of an offshore grid structure and the impact of onshore grid constraints. The analysis includes two interrelated simulation steps. The first step focuses on the strategic use of hydro energy in the day-ahead market, where detailed modelling of water courses and hydro production in the Nordic region is considered. Then, in a second step, flow-based simulations are conducted on a detailed grid model for the whole European system. The results show that long-term strategies for the expansion of offshore and onshore grids must be defined in a coordinated way to ensure optimal developments.

2014,Key parameters for the optimization of a Wind Farm: Impact on the offshore substation,CIGRE Session 45 - 45th International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2014,"As offshore wind farms increase in size, their locations move further away from the shore to deeper waters, resulting in a more significant impact on the farm's collection and transmission grid. The role of this grid - including MV equipment in the wind-turbine, inter-array grid, offshore substation(s), and transmission cables- is crucial for the whole farm in both steady and transient conditions. Indeed, in normal conditions, energy lost during transmission from wind turbine generators to the onshore substation can be significant, making it mandatory to optimize the system in order to increase efficiency while minimizing losses and investment costs. Furthermore, in fault conditions, since one incident in the offshore transmission grid can create a substantial loss for the generation company if the design is not optimized, a balance between reliability and cost has to be found. Only using onshore best practices and proven equipment could not be considered as the most suitable solution. In this paper, we will describe the impacts of the different determining parameters for the optimization of a large wind farm on the electrical equipments of the offshore grid when increasing the inter-array voltage from Medium Voltage (MV) to High Voltage (HV), with a special focus on the impact on the offshore substation. The first part will deal with the technical impact of high voltage inter-array, focusing on the electrical equipment, the losses, the flexibility and the temporary overvoltages. One drawback of the MV level is the restrictive limit for both maximum voltage and current, which establishes a limit regarding the maximum power that can be transmitted by each one of the Wind Farm's internal circuits. As the power of wind farm and WT are increasing, the current rating is increasing at MV level and more power could be conveyed by each cable through using bigger cable sections and increasing the power losses. Increasing voltage level will increase the limit of the Wind Farm's transmitted power, as well as reducing the losses and the section of cables. The second part of the paper will focus on the economical impact of increasing voltage in the collection system; a few scenarios will be described based on a 500 MW wind farm and a global picture, with the given regarding all impacts of this voltage upgrade. © 2014 CIGRE.

2014,Considerations in design of an offshore network,CIGRE Session 45 - 45th International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2014,"The vast potential of offshore wind energy and the challenge of connecting it into onshore AC systems from possibly very distant locations is attracting interest in offshore networks based on HVDC technology using voltage source converters (VSC). However, while a number of visions have been expressed for how an offshore grid in, for example, the North Sea in Europe might look, investors are yet to commit to the development of offshore grids as such and a number of design and economic questions should be considered. The paper discusses various engineering, regulatory and economic issues associated with offshore networks. In particular, it compares AC and HVDC options for simple connections, considers the benefits of coordinated offshore network development and asks whether, in an offshore context, conventions on secure operation that are customary in design and operation of onshore transmission networks are still relevant. It is argued that, except where a loss of infeed issue would be caused for an onshore grid to which an offshore DC grid is connected, the lack of demand offshore means that rules can re-evaluated. This leads into a discussion of the need for DC circuit breakers and reliable fault detection and selection on a multi-terminal DC grid and options for the control of a DC grid. Finally, a number of institutional issues are described including the role of offshore transission owners and sharing of the costs and benefits of an offshore network. © 2014 CIGRE.

2015,Resampling of data for offshore grid design based on kernel density estimation and genetic algorithm,Energy Procedia,"Offshore wind power has been a major focus in the renewable energy development in recent years, due to better wind speeds and wind energy are available offshore. Since the development (construction and grid connection) of offshore windfarms is relatively more expensive in nature, careful planning and design are needed to maximise the benefits of the offshore wind projects. Optimisation with only one operational state is not sufficient in grid design as the state of power system is not stationary due to the fluctuations of the wind power and power consumption. Eventually this leads to the fluctuation of the base load power generations. To account for this variability, the optimisation has to be done with many operational states. Historical data of power consumption at each load centre and simulation data of wind power have to be used to describe the system states. Ideally, the complete set of data should be used to describe the power system states but this could also lead to unsolvable case as there are too many unknowns involved in the calculation. To keep the number of states as low as possible to reduce the computation time, selection of smaller number of samples that can represent the whole data set has to be carried out. This involves detail studies of the statistical distributions of the data. This study is therefore dedicated to develop a procedure for selecting a set of statistically sound samples to represent the entire data set for grid design purposes. © 2015 The Authors.

2014,Near zero energy islands in the Mediterranean: Supporting policies and local obstacles,Energy Policy,"Based on a recent technical-economical analysis on the island of Pantelleria, a policy feasibility study for a complete upgrading of the energy system of this Mediterranean Island is carried out. Pantelleria, situated between Sicily and Africa, owns a large potential in terms of renewable energy resources, although there are some obstacles in turning it into a Near Zero Energy system. Starting from a deep energy system audit, the study proposes the project for a near zero energy island, through the efficient transformation of the different existing natural energy resources into electrical energy and heat: the solar, the wind-based and the geothermal systems. In this way, the island can be turned into an almost autonomous system. The main difficulties connected to the implementation of the project can be identified in the national energy policies as well as in the specific local situation, characterized by a strong private monopole on generation and distribution of electrical energy which has no incentive for supporting the costs connected to the energy requalification of the island. On the other hand, the local administrations, involved in the project through bottom-up European policies, do not have the cultural and economic tools to go on with the implementation. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

2017,Coordination and uncertainty in strategic network investment: Case on the North Seas Grid,Energy Economics,"The notion of developing a transnational offshore grid in the North Sea has attracted considerable attention in the past years due to its potential for substantial capital savings and increased scope for cross-border trade, sparking a European-wide policy debate on incentivizing integrated transmission solutions. However, one important aspect that has so far received limited attention is that benefits will largely depend on the eventual deployment pattern of electricity infrastructure which is currently characterized by severe locational, sizing and timing uncertainty. Given the lack of coordination between generation and network developments across Europe, there is a real risk for over-investment or a premature lock-in to options that exhibit limited adaptability. In the near future, important choices that have to be made concerning the network topology and amount of investment. In this paper we identify the optimal, in terms of reduced cost, network investment (including topology) in the North Seas countries under four deployment scenarios and five distinct policy choices differing in the level of offshore coordination and international market integration. By drawing comparisons between the study results, we quantify the net benefit of enabling different types of coordination under each scenario. Furthermore, we showcase a novel min–max regret optimization model and identify minimum regret first-stage commitments which could be deployed in the near future in order to enhance strategic optionality, increase adaptability to different future conditions and hence reduce any potential sub-optimality of the initial network design. In view of the above, we put forward specific policy recommendations regarding the adoption of a flexible anticipatory expansion framework for the identification of attractive investment opportunities under uncertainty. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."

2015,The power of the offshore (super-) grid in advancing marine regionalization,Ocean and Coastal Management,"Large scale and transnational electricity grids facilitate balancing capacity across the areas that they serve and increase potential for energy trading. Offshore grids and the more ambitious notion of supergrids are beginning to play a significant part, especially in Europe, in the realization of improving security of domestic energy supply and expanding renewable energy production. As such, offshore (super-) grid development provides an excellent example of the move towards marine regionalization. Moreover, because of limited spatial claims and environmental impacts, marine electricity systems seem well-aligned with the rationale of ecosystem-based management, which is at the heart of European marine governance. By outlining their historical path and the envisioned outlook, in this article we show how offshore (super-) grid developments link up to marine regionalization and its related processes of integration and cooperation. It is argued that scaling-up grids to the level of regional seas is not unproblematic, but faces obstacles which depend on persistent practical and policy realities, and which may be relevant to other expressions of marine regionalization. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd."

Hence an offshore ac-island-grid results, in which the HVDC station generates the grid while the inverters of the wind power plants synchronize themselves on that gird.

2016,Frequency control during transients in offshore wind parks using battery energy storage systems,Journal of Marine Engineering and Technology,"The main objective of this paper is to study the implementation of a battery energy storage system (BESS) in order to improve the dynamic behaviour of an offshore wind farm. Special attention is given to the frequency excursions limitation in the sequence of a fault on the onshore grid. This goal is accomplished by setting up a case study in which an offshore wind farm is connected to an onshore grid through a high voltage direct current line commutated converter (HVDC-LCC) link. The Power System Simulator for Engineering (PSS/E) simulation tool is used to implement the whole system, including the onshore and offshore grids and the load flow and dynamic models of the conventional generators, the wind turbine generators (WTGs), the HVDC-LCC link and the BESS. With the BESS out of service, some protective actions of the DC link lead to the uncontrolled frequency increase of the WTG, which are consequently tripped out. The BESS proves to be essential, as it allows the offshore wind farm to keep running by maintaining the frequency of the WTG at acceptable levels and therefore bringing the entire system to a steady state operating point. © 2016 Institute of Marine Engineering, Science & Technology."
2017,Integrating Offshore Wind Power Via Fractional Frequency Transmission System,IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,"A novel solution to integrating offshore wind power via the fractional frequency transmission system (FFTS) is introduced in this paper. The basic idea of FFTS is to improve the technical and economic performance of ac transmission systems by lowering the grid frequency. FFTS is especially suitable for transmitting offshore wind power because the low frequency dramatically reduces the charging current in the cable. In addition, as a novel ac transmission system, FFTS performs much better than HVDC in constructing a multiterminal (MT) grid. The basic structures and characteristics of a typical PMSG-based FFTS offshore wind power system and a MT-FFTS offshore grid are described first. Then two offshore wind power cases are used to compare the technical and economical pros and cons of the FFTS solution with the conventional solutions: HVAC and HVDC. The feasibility studies show that the performance of FFTS offshore wind power system is superior to that of HVAC and HVDC in both point-to-point (PP) and multiterminal cases. The uniform annual value of PP-FFTS and MT-FFTS is 5.01% and 5.07% cheaper than PP-HVDC and MT-HVDC. Therefore, FFTS is a promising solution to offshore wind power integration and building offshore grids. © 1986-2012 IEEE."
2017,"Integrated North Sea grids: The costs, the benefits and their distribution between countries",Energy Policy,"A large number of offshore wind farms and interconnectors are expected to be constructed in the North Sea region over the coming decades, creating substantial opportunities for the deployment of integrated network solutions. Creating interconnected offshore grids that combine cross-border links and connections of offshore plants to shore offers multiple economic and environmental advantages for Europe's energy system. However, despite evidence that integrated solutions can be more beneficial than traditional radial connection practices, no such projects have been deployed yet. In this paper we quantify costs and benefits of integrated projects and investigate to which extent the cost-benefit sharing mechanism between participating countries can impede or encourage the development of integrated projects. Three concrete interconnection case studies in the North Sea area are analysed in detail using a national-level power system model. Model outputs are used to compute the net benefit of all involved stakeholders under different allocation schemes. Given the asymmetric distribution of costs and benefits, we recommend to consistently apply the Positive Net Benefit Differential mechanism as a starting point for negotiations on the financial closure of investments in integrated offshore infrastructure. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2016,The Harmonic Stability Problem in Offshore Wind Farms and Targeted Extension of the HVDC Link Control for its Mitigation,IFAC-PapersOnLine,"This paper analyses the effect of the HVDC controller on the harmonic stability of the offshore wind farm. Due to the HVDC filters/ transformers and long cables wind farms have natural resonances which are normally damped by the grid itself However, improperly designed controllers could excite such resonances which may result in equipment damage. To overcome this problem, HVDC controller is extended with a resonance suppression control which is based on the main ideas of disturbance rejection technique. The effectiveness of the proposed method is analyzed for different operational conditions of the network. It is also observed that the gains of the PI voltage controller play a significant role in the harmonic stability of the offshore grid. © 2016"
2017,Self-Synchronization of Wind Farm in an MMC-Based HVDC System: A Stability Investigation,IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion,"The stability of an offshore wind power network connected through a high-voltage dc (HVDC) transmission line can be challenging since a strong ac collection (ACC) bus might not be available, when there is no rotating machine connected in that bus. In addition, the synchronization unit (phase-locked loop, PLL) has shown to have a significant impact in achieving satisfactory performance. To tackle this problem, this paper has proposed a wind energy conversion system (WECS) controller for such an ACC bus based on the synchronverter concept. A synchronverter - an inverter without PLL that mimics the synchronization mechanism inherent to synchronous generator - is introduced in the grid side of WECS voltage-source converter (VSC), where the wind farms are connected to ac network through a modular multilevel converter (MMC)-based HVDC system. In order to determine the stability of the interconnected system, an impedance-based stability method is adopted. The impedances of both the wind power inverter and the MMC-HVDC converter are analytically derived, and the analytical model is verified by comparing the frequency responses obtained from numerical simulation. The detailed analysis and the results presented show the benefits of this controller and its potential for stability. The results highlights the synchronverter's ability in keeping better performance compared to PLL-based dq-domain control in point of stability and control in integrating offshore wind farm through the MMC-based HVDC system, since the impedance of the synchronverter reflects a simple RL characteristic. On the other hand, the impedance of PLL-based dq-domain control impedance is inductive above 2 kHz and reflects composite characteristics below 2 kHz with different resonance points and with higher impedance magnitude at low frequencies, making it more vulnerable to voltage instability. Finally, time-domain simulation results are presented to validate the theoretical analysis and to show how the self-synchronization impacts on the system performance. © 2017 IEEE."

The proposed method introduces a controlled voltage drop at offshore grid when an onshore fault occurs. The idea behind is to achieve a fast power reduction. Additionally in the proposed idea, every individual wind turbine detects the voltage drop of offshore grid almost simultaneously, then its controller decreases the power set-point to reduce the power output from each wind turbine. The effectiveness of this method is verified by numerical simulations performed in PSCAD. © 2016 The Authors."
2015,Current source converter series tapping of a LCC-HVDC transmission system for integration of offshore wind power plants,IET Seminar Digest,"When using HVDC there are two available commercial possibilities: Transmissions based on Line Commutated Converters (LCC) and based on Voltage Source Converters (VSC). VSC-HVDC is more suitable for creating offshore grids. Despite this fact, many LCC transmission systems are in operation across the sea interconnecting mainlands or islands. This work addresses the concept of connecting wind power plants in series with an LCC-HVDC transmission link already built by means of a self-commutating Current Source Converter (CSC). The idea is similar to series tapping stations which can extract power form the HVDC link. Nevertheless, a CSC can act as a rectifier or inverter, so power reversal is available and has the same advantages of a VSC. The coupling between LCC stations and the CSC is straightforward since both topologies are current source converters. The control and operation of the system under normal conditions is presented and verified by means of simulations using MATLAB Simulink."
2014,Analysis of north sea offshore wind power variability,Resources,"This paper evaluates, for a 2030 scenario, the impact on onshore power systems in terms of the variability of the power generated by 81 GW of offshore wind farms installed in the North Sea. Meso-scale reanalysis data are used as input for computing the hourly power production for offshore wind farms, and this total production is analyzed to identify the largest aggregated hourly power variations. Based on publicly available information, a simplified representation of the coastal power grid is built for the countries bordering the North Sea. Wind farms less than 60 km from shore are connected radially to the mainland, while the rest are connected to a hypothetical offshore HVDC (High-Voltage Direct Current) power grid, designed such that wind curtailment does not exceed 1% of production. Loads and conventional power plants by technology and associated cost curves are computed for the various national power systems, based on 2030 projections. Using the MATLAB-based MATPOWER toolbox, the hourly optimal power flow for this regional hybrid AC/DC grid is computed for high, low and medium years from the meso-scale database. The largest net load variations are evaluated per market area and related to the extra load-following reserves that may be needed from conventional generators. © 2014 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland."

2017,Assessing the impact of sampling and clustering techniques on offshore grid expansion planning,Energy Procedia,"Due to the ongoing large-scale connection of non-dispatchable renewable energy sources to the power systems, short- to long-term planning models are challenged by an increasing level of variability and uncertainty. A key contribution of this article is to explore and assess the implications of different dimension reduction approaches for long-term Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) models. For the purpose of this study, a selection of sampling and clustering techniques are introduced to compare the resulting sample errors with a variety of sampling sizes and two different scaling options of the original data set. Based on the generated samples, a range of TEP model runs are carried out to investigate their impacts on investment strategies and market operation in a case study reflecting offshore grid expansion in the North Sea region for a 2030 scenario. The evaluations show that dimension reduction techniques performing well in the sampling and clustering process do not necessarily produce reliable results in the large-scale TEP model. Future work should include ways of incorporating inter-temporal constraints to better capture medium-term dynamics and the operational flexibility in power system models. © 2017 The Author(s)."

2016,Reshaping Equilibria: Renewable Energy Mega-Projects and Energy Security,Low-Carbon Energy Security from a European Perspective,"Renewable energy mega-projects have the potential to play a significant role in Europe's transition to a low-carbon energy system. However, the question remains whether these expansive undertakings will contribute to energy security. Four mega-projects at various stages of planning, construction and implementation are examined in this chapter. Two projects in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, Noor and DESERTEC, interpret the idea of interdependent energy systems in contrasting ways, the latter relying on the existing paradigm of physical connectedness and the former building new bridges through economic and scientific cooperation. The first interconnected offshore site, Kriegers Flak, and the North Seas Countries Offshore Grid Initiative (NSCOGI) exemplify the different approaches to balancing issues of capacity and system efficiency. The resulting analysis shows that reshaping equilibria for low-carbon energy security with the help of large-scale renewable energy projects leads to much deeper questions of the prevailing energy policy paradigms. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.."
2015,Simulation study of renewable energy driven microgrid,Journal of Electrical Engineering,"Ever-increasing demand for energy and an increasing concern for manmade climatic changes have called for changes in the ways of electricity being generated and distributed and delivered.Micro grids are a peer-to-peer self-sustaining community Managing local generation, storage, loads, and with exclusively grid connectivity. MGs are being considered for much more than their ability to create energy islands that protect from broad power outages. Our work highlights the architecture of a MG which is driven by renewable sources which a conceptual solution for the power outages. The work begins with modeling of the following studies like, Simulation study of TNEB distribution network, Optimal placement of the Distributed sources (DG's), Remodeling of solar PV and Wind Turbine, MG integration and reactive power compatibilities with different DG's and Voltage regulation of low voltage MG network. This low voltage distribution system is converted to MGs, having distributed generation sources (DG's), which is identified through sensitivity analysis. The modeled system tested for feasibility through several case studies."
2017,Smart load management of water injection systems in offshore oil and gas platforms integrating wind power,IET Renewable Power Generation,"The pollution coming from the use of gas turbines (GTs) in oil and gas (O&G) platforms requires greener solutions. One option is to use wind turbines (WTs) to supply the water injection systems (WISs) and explore smart energy management to make the O&G sector more sustainable. The effect of WT integration, and their the coordination with the local GTs, needs to be carefully analysed since the intermittency of the wind can jeopardise the stability of the offshore grid. The existence of flexible loads (FLEX) interfaced by variable speed drives (VSD), such as WISs, can help overcome the challenges related to wind intermittency and rotor angle stability: suitable control of such non-essential loads can be implemented to reduce the effect of wind power fluctuations, balance power generation and consumption and contribute to the optimal efficiency of the GT adjusting its loading conditions. This work investigates the system dynamics under short-term wind-induced power fluctuations, analysing the evolution of electrical variables, such as active power and generator rotor speed, to evaluate the possible arise of low frequency oscillations. The impact of an adequate WIS load control to increase the system damping is also explored and an algorithm for system damping estimation is proposed. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2017."
2015,Oscillatory phenomena between wind farms and HVDC systems: The impact of control,"2015 IEEE 16th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics, COMPEL 2015","Field experience has shown that sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) and harmonic resonance can happen due to the interaction of wind energy conversion system's (WECS) converter controller, HVDC converter controller and impact of system impedance. This paper investigates the operation and control of WECS employing full-scale converter connected to the electrical network through voltage source converter (VSC)-based high voltage dc (HVDC) transmission system. SSO and harmonic resonance are observed depending on the control implementation of the ac collection bus side HVDC converter. The origin of these oscillations can be attributed to the propagation of the WECS 15 Hz resonance through the WECS full converter DC link and the interaction between the WECS and the dc link dynamics of the HVDC system. An active damping scheme is proposed to improve the system performance. The active damping is implemented to an offshore HVDC system installed with the purpose of integrating two wind farms. An analysis and time domain simulation results and its spectral analysis are presented to show how effective the application of the proposed active damping is. © 2015 IEEE."
2017,A case study of a successful industrial microgrid operation,"2017 4th International Conference on Electrical and Electronics Engineering, ICEEE 2017",The energy structure is undergoing a very serious change with the connection of renewables from the distribution level. One of these important changes that will ensure the sustainability of energy is the successful implementation of the microgrids. It is very important how the microgrid structure can recover itself from a severe system faults and also how the microgrid structure can maintain the balance itself after becoming an energy island. This decoupling and balancing procedure can sometimes be very critical if there is a load that cannot tolerate energy interruptions.

2014,Life cycle assessment of an offshore grid interconnecting wind farms and customers across the North Sea,International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment,"Purpose: This study aims to contribute to an improved understanding of the environmental implications of offshore power grid and wind power development pathways. To achieve this aim, we present two assessments. First, we investigate the impacts of a North Sea power grid enabling enhanced trade and integration of offshore wind power. Second, we assess the benefit of the North Sea grid and wind power through a comparison of scenarios for power generation in affected countries. Methods: The grid scenario explored in the first assessment is the most ambitious scenario of the Windspeed project and is the result of cost minimization analysis using a transmission-expansion-planning model. We develop a hybrid life cycle inventory for array cables; high voltage, direct current (HVDC) links; and substations. The functional unit is 1 kWh of electricity transmitted. The second assessment compares two different energy scenarios of Windspeed for the North Sea and surrounding countries. Here, we utilize a life cycle inventory for offshore grid components together with an inventory for a catalog of power generation technologies from Ecoinvent and couple these inventories with grid configurations and electricity mixes determined by the optimization procedure in Windspeed. Results and discussion: Developing, operating, and dismantling the grid cause emissions of 2.5 g CO2-Eq per kWh electricity transmission or 36 Mt CO2-Eq in total. HVDC cables are the major cause of environmental damage, causing, for example, half of total climate change effects. The next most important contributors are substations and array cabling used in offshore wind parks. Toxicity and eutrophication effects stem largely from leakages from disposed copper and iron mine tailings and overburden. Results from the comparison of two scenarios demonstrate a substantial environmental benefit from the North Sea grid extension and the associated wind power development compared with an alternative generation of electricity from fossil fuels. Offshore grid and wind power, however, entail an increased use of metals and, hence, a higher metal depletion indicator. Conclusions: We present the first life cycle assessment of a large offshore power grid, using the results of an energy planning model as input. HVDC links are the major cause of environmental damage. There are differences across impact categories with respect to which components or types of activities that are responsible for damage. The North Sea grid and wind power are environmentally beneficial by an array of criteria if displacing fossil fuels, but cause substantial metal use. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
2015,Offshore grids for renewables: Do we need a particular regulatory framework?,Economics of Energy and Environmental Policy,"Onshore, generators are connected to the transmission grid by TSOs. This regulatory model could simply be extended to offshore (i.e. Germany), but the connection of offshore wind farms to shore is also an opportunity to test alternatives, i.e. the third party model (i.e. the UK) or the generator model (i.e. Sweden). In this paper, we argue that the third party and generator models are indeed better suited to support the evolution towards larger scale offshore wind farms that are increasingly developed farther out to sea, while the TSO model is better suited to support the evolution towards cross-border offshore grid projects. In other words, an important trade-off needs to be made because none of the existing regulatory models can fulfill all the expectations in the current context in Europe. And, the trade-off has to be made at the regional or EU level because the different national regulatory frameworks are incompatible when applied to a cross-border offshore grid project.

2017,DC protection of a multi-terminal HVDC network featuring offshore wind farms,Energy Procedia,"A protection scheme for DC faults has been designed for a multi-terminal HVDC network used to transfer energy from three large offshore wind farms to shore. The system uses open access models created in the EU-funded BEST-PATHS project, including a manufacturer-supplied wind farm model. Tripping conditions for the DC circuit breakers are found through simulation, along with current limiting inductor sizes, based on the use of a hybrid circuit breaker. Simulations of faults in the HVDC network show the ability of the protection scheme to isolate the fault, and the converter stations and wind turbines are able to ride-through the fault without tripping based on the 5ms switching time of the circuit breakers Longer switching times will cause significant rises in the offshore grid frequency, which could cause the turbines to trip."
2014,Coordinated control of wind farm and VSC-HVDC system using capacitor energy and kinetic energy to improve inertia level of power systems,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,"For large-scale offshore wind power integration to main grids over a long distance, the VSC-HVDC transmission is a typical way. However, the asynchronous characteristic of HVDC link leads to the frequency decouple of the offshore grid and the main grid, i.e., the offshore grid has little or no inertia support for the main grid. The high level penetration of wind energy makes the main grid an ""inertia-less"" system and impairs the overall stability of the system. This paper proposes a new coordinated control strategy which uses the electrical energy stored in the DC capacitors and the kinetic energy stored in wind turbine rotors to emulate the inertia of synchronous generators. By this control strategy, the DC link capacitors release or absorb energy following the droop DC voltage control of the grid side VSC (GSVSC), and the wind farm VSC (WFVSC) changes its output frequency according to the DC voltage. Thus, an artificial coupling of the frequencies of the two-side AC systems is obtained without remote communication. According to the WFVSC's output frequency, the wind turbine power controller alters its power reference, and the wind turbine speed changes. Thus, the kinetic energy stored in wind turbine rotors is absorbed or released. As a result, the wind turbine is utilized to keep the main grid frequency stable. Based on the doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) wind turbine, this paper analyzes the influence of different additional power controllers and different control parameters of the proposed control strategy on the inertia time constant. Within the permissible range of the DC voltage variation, the proposed control strategy can provide a wide range of inertia time constant, which improves the overall stability of the main grid system. Simulation results of three operation conditions, i.e., sudden load changes, variation of the wind speed, and AC system faults, validated the effectiveness of the proposed coordinated control strategy. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

2014,Regulating offshore energy sources in the North Sea - Reinventing the wheel or a need for more coordination?,International Journal of Marine and Coastal Law,"In this article we examine the legal frameworks for developing oil, gas and wind energy in the North Sea. We discuss whether there are parallels to be seen and lessons to be learned from these different sectors and suggest that experience in the offshore petroleum sector could be used to improve the evolving legal regimes for offshore wind energy. For this purpose, we first examine the legal basis for offshore activities under the international law of the sea. Subsequently, we discuss the regulation of oil and gas exploitation and the regulation of offshore wind energy. We focus in particular on the way in which energy sources are transported to shore via pipelines and cables. We consider whether comparable decisions have been made when establishing a legal regime for offshore wind and whether lessons could still be learned. This is particularly relevant for the future when the production of offshore wind energy and the production of petroleum need to be coordinated, and when sizable amounts of offshore wind energy will be integrated into the (offshore) transmission grid. © 2014 Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden."
2017,Optimization-based reactive power control in HVDC-connected wind power plants,Renewable Energy,"One application of high–voltage dc (HVdc) systems is the connection of remotely located offshore wind power plants (WPPs). In these systems, the offshore WPP grid and the synchronous main grid operate in decoupled mode, and the onshore HVdc converter fulfills the grid code requirements of the main grid. Thus, the offshore grid can be operated independently during normal conditions by the offshore HVdc converter and the connected wind turbines. In general, it is well known that optimized reactive power allocation might lower the component loading and power losses. This paper aims to propose and assess a reactive power allocation optimization within HVdc–connected WPPs. For these systems, the offshore converter operates the adjoining grid by imposing frequency and voltage. The reference voltage magnitude is used as additional control variable for the optimization algorithm. The loss function incorporates both the collection grid and the converter losses. The use of the proposed strategy results in an effective reduction of losses compared to conventional reactive power dispatch strategies alongside with improvements of the voltage profile. A case study for a 500 MW–sized WPP demonstrates an additional annual energy production of 6819 MWh or an economical benefit of 886 kyr−1 when using the proposed strategy. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd"
2016,Marine wind energy and the North Sea Offshore Grid Initiative: A Multi-Level Perspective on a stalled technology transition?,Energy Research and Social Science,"Building electricity grids out to sea implies a radical transformation of grid topologies. In time, a marine super-grid is conceivable. If growing numbers of subsea electricity cables are meshed with marine renewable, a ‘greening’ of such grids is also possible. Based on interview research, this paper examines one such ambitious proposal: the Northern Seas Countries Offshore Grid Initiative (NSCOGI). The Multi-Level Perspective (MLP) on technology transitions is used to evaluate progress to date. Obstacles uncovered include competing and still immature grid technology niches. There is only equivocal support from key actors within the relevant socio-technical electricity regime. National grid Transmission System Operators (TSOs) appear more interested in subsea cables to trade electricity rather than enhancing marine renewables. While the EU might be assumed to be a vital actor to support a North Sea Grid, it has only limited influence. National policy insiders and decisions matter more. This paper stresses the residual importance of the national level for offshore wind and electricity grids. A marine super-grid wired up with offshore wind-farms throughout the North Sea, is both more tentative in its emergence, but also ambiguous in its support for offshore wind. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd"
2016,Management through hope: an ethnography of Denmark’s Renewable Energy Island,Journal of Organizational Ethnography,"Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to analyse the process of social and technical change that took place between 1997 and 2007 through which Samsø, a rural island of 4,000 inhabitants, became Denmark’s Renewable Energy Island (REI). Design/methodology/approach – Building on ethnographic fieldwork conducted on Samsø in 2013 and 2014, the paper takes as its starting point a citizens’ meeting in which a new renewable energy project is proposed by a municipal coordinator. This meeting, in which the municipal coordinator exhibits a “change management” attitude, fails to win the citizens’ support and becomes an entry point into an investigation of how the REI project developers managed to get the island community to actively support the project. A gateway to the past, the meeting allows the author to ethnographically describe the unobserved events of 1997-2007. Findings – The argument is that the REI project developers practised management through hope or “hope management”, in contrast to “change management”, creating a project that succeeded in accomplishing its goals of changing the island due to its openness, its rootedness in the island community’s past, and the project developers’ ability to speak to a down-to-earth variety of hope. Originality/value – The paper makes use of an ethnographic study of the present to investigate an unobserved past in which a REI was built. Taking up the “hope debate” in anthropology and Science and Technology Studies (Stengers, 2002; Miyazaki, 2004; Jensen, 2014), the paper contributes with an empirical analysis of the role of hope in the management of change processes. © 2016, © Emerald Group Publishing Limited."

2014,Solar photo voltaic power generation in union territory of Lakshadweep Island: Projected level dissemination using technology diffusion models,"Proceedings of the International Conference on Innovative Applications of Computational Intelligence on Power, Energy and Controls with Their Impact on Humanity, CIPECH 2014","Lakshadweep Island is one of the union territory of India. The main source of electricity in Lakshadweep Island is diesel generators, the diesel being transported from the main land. Due to high energy costs, the islands are proving to be excellent test beds for the introduction of new technologies, and becoming so-called renewable energy islands to satisfy their energy demand mainly from indigenous and renewable energy sources. With its fragile locations, geographical and environmental limitations it is desirable to explore possible strategies to utilize maximum available potential of non-polluting renewable energy sources for this ecologically sensitive island. This paper examines the penetration of renewable energy sources in general and dissemination of solar photo voltaic (SPV) based power generation of electricity in particular for balance solution to the energy problems of Lakshadweep Island using technology diffusion models. It was found that with different diffusion models, the future time frame of SPV based power generation is likely to reach its maximum estimated potential in another 40 years. © 2014 IEEE."

2016,Active power flow direction effect on stability in multi-terminal VSC-HVDC transmission system in integrating wind farm,"2016 IEEE 17th Workshop on Control and Modeling for Power Electronics, COMPEL 2016","Variation of wind power affects the stability of a multi-terminal HVDC (MT-HVDC) system installed in the purpose of integrating offshore wind farms and supplying an offshore constant power load in oil and gas plat form. This paper investigates the stability of such MT-HVDC system. In order to determine the stability, an impedance-based stability method is adopted. The stability is determined by checking the Nyquist plot of minor loop gain. It has been observed that a high control bandwidth of the dc voltage control loop has better system performance; however the stability margin is very poor and vice versa. Moreover, the dc voltage controlled-converter needs to operate both as an inverter and a rectifier to provide the flexibility of having the power flows both directions and with a high control bandwidth of the dc voltage control loop, the converter cannot operate stably in rectifier mode, on the other hand with a low control bandwidth, the converter operates stably both as an inverter and rectifier; however the system performance is very poor. In order to improve the system performance, a droop control is introduced and the performance of the droop is validated in simulation. The detailed analysis is presented for different power levels of the wind farm and is shown how it affects the stability of the interconnected system. © 2016 IEEE."
2016,Introducing system flexibility to a multinational transmission expansion planning model,"19th Power Systems Computation Conference, PSCC 2016","Grid investments are considered as sunk costs with a very long lifetime, particularly in an offshore grid context. The market mechanisms for cost recovery of these investments are exposed to an increasing share of variable power generation at the supply side, demanding more flexibility in the system. Hence, it is of great interest to account for these changes in tools being used for decision support. This paper presents an extension of an already existing mixed integer linear program (MILP) for transmission expansion planning (TEP), by including system flexibility in the form of energy storage and demand-side management. Moreover, an enhanced description of variable power generation is used to construct production profiles with a higher level of detail. The latter is achieved by simulating weather data for wind and solar incorporating higher temporal and spatial resolution than in previous studies. The impact of using new times series for variable power generation, and the introduction of system flexibility, are both presented separately using the North Sea area for a comparative case study with 2030 scenarios provided by ENTSO-E. The consequent results of interest include lifetime operational costs (OPEX), investment costs (CAPEX), and offshore wind power curtailment. © 2016 Power Systems Computation Conference."
2016,Offshore AC grid management for an AC integrated VSC-HVDC scheme with large WPPs,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,"Point-to-point VSC-HVDC Wind power plant (WPP) links connected offshore by AC cables can be called an AC integrated VSC-HVDC scheme or virtual multi-terminal DC (MTDC) grid. Since, the AC integrated VSC-HVDC scheme forms an offshore AC grid, parallel operation of offshore VSC-HVDC converters is required. This paper compares three offshore converter control topologies: (i) feedforward control of AC voltage and frequency, (ii) feedback control of AC voltage, and (iii) feedback control of AC voltage and frequency with an inner current loop. The performance of power and current based droops has been assessed for the parallel offshore converters.

2015,The Effect of Welfare Distribution and Cost Allocation on Offshore Grid Design,IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy,"Innovative offshore grid designs such as integrating offshore wind farms (OWFs) with interconnectors are gaining popularity. Adequate investment in these designs requires aligning the interest of stakeholders through an appropriate cost allocation method. The aim of this paper is twofold. First, it shows how welfare distribution can influence a stakeholders offshore grid design choice. Second, it evaluates the effect of various cost allocation schemes in aligning diverse stakeholder interests toward efficient grid design. The results confirm that an investment in an efficient offshore grid design may not be guaranteed as long as the chosen cost allocation method ignores the welfare distribution effect. Most methods fail in this regard. Even when they provide cost incentives, they do not always ensure cooperation. Cognizant of this limitation, this study proposes a method that allocates costs in proportion to the incremental net benefit (PINB) of each stakeholder. This method reflects both the distribution of welfare and cost savings. © 2010-2012 IEEE."
2016,A reliability evaluation of offshore HVDC grid configuration options,IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,"This paper details a methodology for investigating the reliability of different offshore grid design options for the connection of offshore wind power to shore. The methodology uses a sequential Monte Carlo-based technique that enables the investigation of realistic offshore phenomena, such as the weather dependency of component repair times. A number of case studies are examined for the connection to shore of a cluster of far offshore wind farms and a cost benefit analysis is performed which compares the capital costs, electrical losses, and reliability of each. There is found to be a clear value in options that have inherent redundancy and alternative protection strategies, which avoid the use of expensive dc circuit breakers, that are shown to be potentially viable. It is also found that low probability, high impact faults, such as transmission branch failures, are a key driver behind overall grid reliability. © 1986-2012 IEEE."
2017,Characterisation of interaction in an offshore AC grid with large WPPs and VSC-HVDCs,IET Renewable Power Generation,"To exploit the full and flexible capability of offshore voltage-sourced converter high-voltage DC (VSC-HVDC) lines, interaction studies in the offshore AC grid are required but are not well understood or reported. This study examines the interaction dynamics of an offshore AC grid for interconnecting large wind power plants (WPPs). The conventional eigenvalue analysis method has limitations which make the interaction analysis of such systems difficult. Hence, in this study, an impedance-based analytical approach is employed to investigate the interaction phenomena. The impedance model of a VSCHVDC converter for both direct and vector control with outer and droop controls are derived along with the impedance model of the full-converter wind generator. The interaction dynamics of the offshore grid is predicted through the well-established Nyquist criteria and is validated using time-domain simulations. The analysis shows that the system stability is decidedly influenced by the control configurations and tuning of the VSC-HVDC lines. © 2017 The Institution of Engineering and Technology."
2015,Stochastic optimal power flow incorporating offshore wind farm and electric vehicles,International Journal of Electrical Power and Energy Systems,"In this paper, an optimal power flow model of a power system, which includes an offshore wind farm and plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) connected to grid, is presented. The stochastic nature of wind power and the uncertainties in the EV owner's behavior are suitably modelled by statistical models available in recent literatures. The offshore wind farms are assumed to be composed of doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) having reactive power control capability and are connected to offshore grid by HVDC link. In order to obtain the optimal active power schedules of different energy sources, an optimization problem is solved by applying recently introduced Gbest guided artificial bee colony algorithm (GABC). The accuracy of proposed approach has been tested by implementing AC-DC optimal power flow on modified IEEE 5-bus, IEEE 9-bus, and IEEE 39-bus systems. The results obtained by GABC algorithm are compared with the results available in literatures. This paper also includes AC-DC optimal power flow model, implemented on modified IEEE-30 bus test system by including wind farm power and V2G source. It has been shown that the uncertainty associated with availability of power from wind farm and PEVs affects the overall cost of operation of system. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

Dimension reduction methods can be used to keep the planning models tractable, e.g. time series sampling and clustering, but they represent a trade-off between model complexity and level of detail. The accuracy of dimension reduction methods can be measured both in terms of raw data processing and model output metrics, where the latter reveals how well a sampling technique fits that particular model instance. In this study, the robustness of several sampling and clustering techniques is quantified with different model instances by independently varying model parameters, such as e.g. the marginal cost of generation. As the obtained findings indicate that the performance of the considered techniques is, indeed, model-dependent, more insight into the performance of common dimension reduction techniques in power system planning applications is provided. The results are illustrated by a case study of the North Sea Offshore Grid (NSOG) for the scenario year 2030, using a bi-level mixed-integer linear optimization program.

The proposed DC grid employs a 5-port inductor-capacitorinductor (LCL) fault tolerant MMC DC hub which interconnects several HVDC cables. The hub achieves power flow control between different terminals, DC voltage stepping using no internal AC transformer, and most importantly it enables DC fault isolation from each port. The faulty port is isolated form the healthy ports of the system using internal AC circuit breakers if the fault is persistent. Advanced control architecture is proposed for all MMC terminals and DC hub MMC VSCs to guarantee stable grid behaviour in normal operation and during severe DC faults. The whole system is modelled in PSCAD and simulation results are presented to confirm acceptable performance of the proposed DC grid."

In our problem formulation, the charge/discharge schedules of energy storage are modeled in such a way that market conditions in the succeeding hours are taken into account in the power dispatch at present. Both unlimited and limited energy storage capacity scenarios are considered, and compared to a no-storage reference case. The optimal plan includes grid topology, transmission capacities, energy storage capacities and optimal energy storage schedules. The optimization model sets the transmission capacities in such a way that transmission congestion revenue collected throughout the lifetime of the infrastructure pays off the investment cost of building the grid. The proposed model is applied to study the future development of an offshore grid in the North Sea. Simulation results are assessed according to various economic indicators.

Today, public hostility toward a projected nearshore wind farm off the island's preserved northern coast is growing. This paper takes its main theoretical cue from Gomart and Hajer's (2003) call to open up political questions to empirical inquiry and to pay attention to the material settings in which political questions unfold. The paper seeks to make sense of the islanders' unexpected opposition to a new wind farm, and it does so through a critique of the unexperimental and depoliticizing attitude - found in the empirical case as well as in some academic scholarship - of the NIMBY (Not In My BackYard) logic. Replacing the NIMBY logic of closing down deliberation with an empirical and 'cosmopolitical' (Stengers, 2005) approach to open up the space of politics to close investigation, the paper focuses on the empirical settings which give the controversy its specifi c shape and asks how the projected wind farm is interrogated, negotiated and recast as it travels through the socio-material politics of the wind controversy."
2017,Analysis of reactive power strategies in HVDC-connected wind power plant clusters,Wind Energy,"Offshore wind power plants (WPPs) built near each other but far from shore usually connect to the main grid by a common high-voltage DC (HVDC) transmission system. In the resulting decoupled offshore grid, the wind turbine converters and the high-voltage DC voltage-source converter share the ability to inject or absorb reactive power. The overall reactive power control dispatch influences the power flows in the grid and hence the associated power losses. This paper evaluates the respective power losses in HVDC-connected WPP clusters when applying 5 different reactive power control strategies. The case study is made for a 1.2-GW–rated cluster comprising 3 WPP and is implemented in a combined load flow and converter loss model. A large set of feasible operating points for the system is analyzed for each strategy. The results show that a selection of simulations with equal wind speeds is sufficient for the annual energy production comparison. It is found that the continuous operation of the WPPs with unity power factor has a superior performance with low communication requirements compared with the other conventional strategies. The optimization-based strategy, which is developed in this article, allows a further reduction of losses mainly because of the higher offshore grid voltage level imposed by the high-voltage DC voltage-source converter. Reactive power control in HVDC-connected WPP clusters change significantly the overall power losses of the system, which depend rather on the total sum of the injected active power than on the variance of wind speeds inside the cluster.

2014,Impact of DC voltage control parameters on AC/DC system dynamics under faulted conditions,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,"This paper discusses the influence of dynamics within a multi-terminal offshore DC grid (MTDC) on the onshore AC power system stability under faulted conditions. An AC-fault occurring at the HVDC converter station terminals may propagate via the offshore MTDC grid to the undisturbed asynchronously connected AC power system. This disturbance manifests itself as additional active power overshoot at the remotely connected converters. It is shown that the severity of this disturbance propagation is sensitive to the parameters of the DC voltage droop control employed for voltage regulation in the MTDC scheme. Furthermore, the effect of the MTDC grid topology on these dynamic interactions is illustrated by comparing a meshed with a radial topology. The analysis has been performed with phasor-mode time domain simulations, augmented with a user-defined state-space model for the MTDC grid. The AC system dynamics are based on available models of benchmark power systems in the stability simulation software PSS®E. © 2014 IEEE."
2016,Price regimes in an energy island: Tacit collusion vs. cost and network explanations,Energy Economics,"In this paper, we explore the determinants of wholesale electricity prices in an energy island such as Sicily, by estimating regime switching models with fixed and time-varying transition probabilities on daily data in the 2012-2014 period. Explanatory variables used alternatively in the price equation and in the switching equation include power demand, the supply of intermittent renewables, the residual supply index, and a congestion indicator. Four competing hypotheses on the determinants of price regimes are tested (arbitrary market power, cost profile, tacit collusion, congestion) in order to understand why, despite the general trend of declining prices induced by renewables in southern Italy, Sicilian prices stood high. The pattern of estimated coefficients is consistent with a tacit collusion story. © 2016."
2016,Process electrification and offshore grid systems,Proceedings of the Annual Offshore Technology Conference,"Objectives/Scope: Oil and gas process electrification is recognized to reduce operating cost, improve energy efficiency and improve environmental factors. Offshore electrification has been limited by distance costs. Now extended reach for AC systems, improved HVDC systems, and emerging availability of offshore gridded systems that can include multiple power sources and consumers are providing improved economics. Methods, Procedures, Process: The full economic and technical analysis is complex. We will examine how technical factors such as power requirements, distance, losses, and maintenance and operating costs combine with key economic criteria such as capital, operations and energy costs, and depreciation. We will then discuss models for how overall availability and operational stability are affected by the energy mix and the quality of the power management of the microgrid. Other factors such as HSE and environmental impact can also affect the investment decision. Results, Observations, Conclusions: Earlier models we presented, such as those in SPE-162504, considered mainly point to point connections. We here demonstrate how gridded systems, including long distance HVDC connections, combine with local AC grids that can integrate multiple offshore facilities and power sources. The paper is based on experience and ongoing projects in the North Sea and current studies in the Persian Gulf and Caspian Sea, where integration across multiple facilities and consumers and network dynamics of multiple sources such as Power from Shore, Local Generation and Offshore wind in microgrids have been studied. (We include actual data from concluded studies, or anonymized data subject to client permission.) Novel/Additive Information: The study focuses on large offshore electrification systems that meet energy, stability and economic requirements in large offshore grids. New information includes the effects of changing from point-to-point connections to grids with many nodes, and includes the effect of renewable power on the grid and the effect of battery energy storage/hybridization.

2017,Transmission expansion simulation for the European Northern Seas offshore grid,Energy,"HVDC innovations and the integration of power markets and renewables drive the development of a European Northern Seas offshore grid. This power transmission system performs two functions: interconnecting Northern European onshore power systems, and connecting offshore wind farms. Despite its benefits, the development of an integrated offshore grid combining the two functions is slow. The main reasons are the lack of cooperation and governance frameworks to overcome regional differences and distribute costs and benefits. These barriers were studied so far only qualitatively or through perfect foresight optimization models. We complement this by studying transmission expansion pathways of the grid, which are non-optimal and path dependent, using a novel and open-source simulation model for offshore transmission investments. Different expansion typologies are considered, which we find perform the grid functions with different levels of integration and transmission capacities. Besides these typology factors, modelling and simulation factors also affect the expansion selection. Typology, modelling and simulation factors interact to result in radically different offshore grid pathways, which exhibit strong path dependence. Thus, to avoid locking-out beneficial expansions for the Northern Seas offshore grid, planning should be regional and consider HVDC innovations. Then individual projects can be implemented based on their own merits. © 2017 The Authors"
2017,Preliminary regulations of ESS connected to Korean isolated island power system to minimise the capacity of ESS,CIRED - Open Access Proceedings Journal,"In the islanding microgrids, a problem can occur when energy storage system (ESS) is operated in constant voltage constant frequency (CVCF) mode. In order to operate ESS in CVCF, it should have enough capacity to ensure total demand required in the grid. If there is energy unbalance between supply and demand and the capacity of ESS is not enough to supply the power required from the loads, distributed generations (DGs) instead of ESS is required to support necessary power to maintain grid frequency constant. However, DGs cannot respond to frequency change due to constant frequency operation of ESS even it has frequency-power support functions. This makes microgrid power system reduce its efficiency and requires enough capacity of ESS, which can ensure total demand of the grid. It causes lower economics problem. In order to help DGs or renewable respond to grid frequency change even in CVCF operation mode of ESS, ESS should have special function named 'indirect voltage regulation' and is presented in the study. This study briefly introduces grid codes for distributed energy resources connected to 'stand-alone energy island' KEPCO is recently carrying out and presents necessity of indirect voltage control of ESS. © 2017 Institution of Engineering and Technology.

2015,North Sea offshore network and energy storage for large scale integration of renewables,Sustainable Energy Technologies and Assessments,"This review investigates different aspects of the realization of a North Sea offshore grid. The North Sea region has several characteristics that make large-scale integration of renewable energy sources attractive, such as large wind resources and huge hydro reservoirs in the North. A meshed offshore grid with underwater storage can contribute to facilitate sufficient flexibility in the system. The technical review reveals some aspects that need more research, particularly regarding the protection schemes. Furthermore, offshore storage solutions are under development. However, most other aspects are covered by readily available solutions. The greatest challenges seem to lie within standardization, cost-benefit sharing and harmonization of regulatory regimes of the surrounding countries. Nevertheless, several studies have shown highly promising economic benefits of establishing an offshore grid in the North Sea compared to traditional planning of point-to-point connections only. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."
2017,Measurement system requirements to evaluate the quality of grid connections for offshore wind farms,"I2MTC 2017 - 2017 IEEE International Instrumentation and Measurement Technology Conference, Proceedings","The number of offshore wind farms in Germany has significantly increased since 2008. For economic reasons the wind farms are clustered and connected to the public grid via large scale HVDC converters. One of the main risks for offshore wind farm operators is the quality of the grid connection provided by the TSO. Dynamic influences of the TSO or neighboring wind farms, originate power quality disturbances and may seriously impact the production of a wind farm. To investigate the influences of the power quality in the offshore grid on the production of the wind farm, power quality must be measured. In this paper the placement and requirements for the measurement devices are determined. Afterwards the different device categories are compared and the benefits of continuous recording high resolution measurement devices are presented on an exemplary power quality event. © 2017 IEEE."
2015,Impact of state-space modelling fidelity on the small-signal dynamics of VSC-HVDC systems,IET Seminar Digest,"The main purpose of the paper is to investigate the effect of state-space modelling fidelity on the small signal stability characteristics of HVDC systems based on Voltage Source Converters (VSCs). For this purpose, a small-signal state-space model of a point-to-point VSC-based HVDC connection, including the dynamics of the ac networks and the converter control loops is developed, and verified by comparison to time responses of a detailed model including the nonlinear effects. Critical modes of the system under worst case operating conditions are investigated by participation factor analysis to show the influence of different states and identify the physical effects associated with the various eigenvalues. The same testcase is investigated by using DigSilent Power Factory (P.F.), as an example of a commercial power system simulation tool, to assess small-signal stability and dynamic behaviour of the system. Thus, the effects of commonly used simplifications for large-scale power system studies on the stability assessment of a VSC-based HVDC transmission scheme are identified, and their influence on the location of critical poles in the system is analysed. The results are used as a basis towards general guidelines on how to assess the results from traditional power system stability studies of networks containing VSC-based transmission schemes and to shed light on the impact of the simplifications on the stability estimate."
2017,Handling of unbalanced faults in HVDC-connected wind power plants,Electric Power Systems Research,"High-voltage DC (HVDC) connections enable integration of wind power plants located very far from shore. The decoupled AC offshore grid comprises multiple WT converters, and the voltage magnitude and frequency is primarily controlled by the offshore high-voltage DC voltage-source converter (VSC-HVDC). Faults in the offshore grid challenge the connected converters to provide an adequate response improving the overall fault behavior. Of special interest are asymmetrical faults due to the resulting unbalanced voltage conditions. This article addresses such conditions in the offshore grid and analyzes the impact on the offshore grid behavior for different converter contributions. Four fault ride-through strategies are studied for the WT converters. The effect of over-modulation of the converter voltages during such voltage conditions is highlighted. A test system is defined to analyze the fault and post-fault behavior. It is found that voltage support from the WT converters in both positive and negative sequence shows the best performance compared to controlled negative sequence current suppression. This scheme helps additionally the VSC-HVDC AC voltage control to return quickly to normal operation. To validate this statement simulations are performed for line-to-line (LL) and single line-to-ground (SLG) faults in immediate vicinity of the VSC-HVDC. © 2017 Elsevier B.V."
2017,Multistage grid investments incorporating uncertainty in offshore wind development,Energy Procedia,"Representation of uncertainty in transmission expansion planning (TEP) models has become increasingly important as many power systems are exposed to significant technological changes induced by top-down climate and energy targets. The objective with this paper is to incorporate uncertainty regarding future offshore wind deployment and allow two investment stages for grid expansion, where the second stage provides valuable flexibility for a system planner. A stochastic two-stage mixed-integer linear program is used for this purpose applied to a case study of the North Sea Offshore Grid (NSOG). With the given data and assumptions, we show that the system planner can gain maximum €1.72 bn (0.40 %) in terms of cost savings under perfect information about the wind deployment. The expected cost savings for a more forward-looking system planner using a stochastic program is €22.30 m (0.0052 %), in comparison with the best deterministic approach. Moreover, we show that if the planner can postpone its investment decision with five years an expected cost saving of €22.41 m would arise. © 2017 The Author(s)."

2016,Coordinated Voltage Control in Offshore HVDC Connected Cluster of Wind Power Plants,IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy,"This paper presents a coordinated voltage control scheme (CVCS) for a cluster of offshore wind power plants connected to a voltage-source converter-based high-voltage direct current system. The primary control point of the proposed voltage control scheme is the introduced Pilot bus, which is having the highest short-circuit capacity in the offshore AC grid. The developed CVCS comprehends an optimization algorithm, aiming for minimum active power losses in the offshore grid, to generate voltage reference to the Pilot bus. During the steady-state operation, the Pilot bus voltage is controlled by dispatching reactive power references to each wind turbine (WT) in the wind power plant cluster based on their available reactive power margin and network sensitivity-based participation factors, which are derived from the dV/dQ sensitivity of a WT bus w.r.t. the Pilot bus. This method leads to the minimization of the risk of undesired effects, particularly overvoltage at the terminals of the WT located far away from the AC collector substation, by dispatching lower reactive power references compared with the ones nearer to the substation. In addition, this paper proposes a control strategy for improved voltage ride through capability of WTs for faults in the offshore grid, thus leading to improved dynamic voltage profile in the offshore AC grid. © 2016 IEEE."

2016,Reactive power management in an offshore AC network having multiple voltage source converters,EEEIC 2016 - International Conference on Environment and Electrical Engineering,"Many offshore wind power plants are being developed every year at North and Baltic Sea. Combined energy transmission to shore instead of standalone is suitable from the prospective of environment and integrated European power market. Offshore ac hub is beneficial for the wind power plants that are far from shore but close to each other within the vicinity of 20 km. This article presents a method of controlling reactive power flow in the offshore ac grid to minimize the power losses and select the suitable network layout. In the proposed scheme, offshore grid frequency and voltage is controlled through more than one converters. Using frequency droop, active power sharing is done among converters and with voltage droop reactive power. Further, the optimization algorithm also provide the set points for wind power plants to contribute in the management of reactive power flow. © 2016 IEEE."
2016,Self-synchronisation of wind farm in MMC-based HVDC system,"2016 IEEE Electrical Power and Energy Conference, EPEC 2016","The stability of an offshore wind power network connected through a high voltage dc (HVDC) transmission line is a critical problem since there is no direct connection to a strong ac collection (ACC) bus. Field experience has shown that sub-synchronous oscillation (SSO) and harmonic resonance can occur between the wind farms and the HVDC systems. The oscillations can appear in the presence of background harmonics and is arguably resulting from the controller interaction of the Wind Energy Conversion System (WECS) converter controller and the HVDC converter controller. The design of the synchronization unit (Phase-Locked-Loop) has shown to have a significant impact in achieving satisfactory performance. However, both slow and very fast synchronization units could directly affect the control performance and degrade the system stability. This paper proposes a controller design without a Phase-Locked-Loop (PLL) for the WECS grid-side converter which does not have a dedicated synchronization unit (PLL) in the controller. This controller is implemented on the WECS converters of the ACC side to synchronize them to the Modular Multi-level Converter (MMC)-based HVDC system. A detailed analysis is presented and the results are compared with the widely used decouple dq-frame control structure. The impedance frequency responses for both the dq-frame control and the synchronverter-based control are presented to show a comparison of the system performance. Time domain simulation results are presented to show how the self-synchronisation impacts on the system performance compared to the classical dq-frame control solution. © 2016 IEEE."

2015,A market-based transmission planning for HVDC grid - Case study of the North Sea,IEEE Transactions on Power Systems,"There is significant interest in building HVDC transmission to carry out transnational power exchange and deliver cheaper electricity from renewable energy sources which are located far from the load centers. This paper presents a market-based approach to solve a long-term TEP for meshed VSC-HVDC grids that connect regional markets. This is in general a nonlinear, non-convex large-scale optimization problem with high computational burden, partly due to the many combinations of wind and load that become possible. We developed a two-step iterative algorithm that first selects a subset of operating hours using a clustering technique, and then seeks to maximize the social welfare of all regions and minimize the investment capital of transmission infrastructure subject to technical and economic constraints. The outcome of the optimization is an optimal grid design with a topology and transmission capacities that results in congestion revenue paying off investment by the end the project's economic lifetime. Approximations are made to allow an analytical solution to the problem and demonstrate that an HVDC pricing mechanism can be consistent with an AC counterpart. The model is used to investigate development of the offshore grid in the North Sea. Simulation results are interpreted in economic terms and show the effectiveness of our proposed two-step approach. © 1969-2012 IEEE."
2017,Impacts of offshore grid developments in the North Sea region on market values by 2050: How will offshore wind farms and transmission lines pay?,"International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM","Increasing the integration of renewable energy in Northern and Central Europe markets is greatly influenced by the development of electricity transmission grid infrastructure. On the background of the fast development of offshore wind energy and its connection to the onshore electricity systems, a coordinated grid development in the North Sea may not only save costs for individual wind farms, but also deliver additional benefits through the provision of increased interconnection of electricity markets. The previous studies do not include offshore wind development with high ambition in the long term perspective and do not focus on the assessment of the specific effects on the economic value of offshore wind farms connected to Belgium, Norway the UK, the Netherlands, and Germany (North Sea Link, Cobra Cable, Viking Link, Nord Link, BritNed and Nemo Link). This paper tries to shed some lights on the substantial differences in the expected economic exposure of wind power plants and transmission lines to the development of the electricity grid in the North Sea. Since details of the prospective energy system around the North Sea region shape these revenue expectations, we further develop and apply the energy model Balmorel. The tool is used to quantify effects of the implementation of a meshed offshore grid compared to a radial grid that connects wind farms in a non-coordinated fashion to the countries by 2050. The model runs conducted for the present paper show substantial variation of expectable market values of wind farms on hub level due to impacts of different options for grid structures.

2017,Optimal fault ride through compliance of offshore wind power plants with VSC-HVDC connection by meta-heuristic based tuning,Electric Power Systems Research,"This paper presents a novel iterative procedure augmented by electromagnetic transient type simulations and the state of the art mean variance mapping optimization algorithm. The aforementioned procedure enables the optimal tuning of coordinated fault ride through compliance strategies for offshore wind power plants with VSC-HVDC transmission. In particular, the formulated optimization task minimizes the electrical stresses experienced by the VSC-HVDC system and the offshore wind power plants during onshore faults. Moreover, it ensures that the onshore and offshore grid code profiles are not violated due to unwanted dynamics associated with the combined response of the VSC-HVDC system and the wind power plants. Two state of the art coordinated fault ride through strategies are optimized, namely the voltage drop and the frequency modulation technique. Simulation results demonstrate that the optimal tuning of coordinated fault ride through compliance strategies by the proposed iterative procedure enables improved dynamic response and reduced electrical stresses for the offshore wind power plant and the VSC-HVDC transmission. © 2016 Elsevier B.V."

For a given level of wind support, the optimal plan includes the grid and offshore wind capacities. Optimal capacities are set in such a way that congestion revenue collected throughout the life time of the project pays off the investment cost of building the grid. At the same time the remuneration of the offshore wind farm recovers the initial investment cost.

2017,Optimal sizing method of distributed energy resources for a stand-alone microgrid by using reliability-based genetic algorithm,Transactions of the Korean Institute of Electrical Engineers,"As the reduction of greenhouse gases(GHGs) emission has become a global issue, the microgrid markets are growing rapidly.

2014,Reliability analysis of design options for offshore HVDC networks,CIGRE Session 45 - 45th International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2014,"There is growing interest in developing offshore HVDC networks to connect both offshore wind power and provide interconnection between regions. There are a number of technology, topology and protection options available to developers each with varying levels of design complexity, capital cost and system redundancy. This paper highlights some of the available options and outlines a methodology for investigating the performance of a number of these through an investigation of their reliability against a lifetime of expected fault conditions, principally through a calculation of the expected level of curtailed energy associated with each network design. A number of case studies are investigated to provide a comparison between options including designs with and without HVDC circuit breakers and with varying levels of interconnection and system redundancy. The paper shows that there are potentially significant benefits in terms of reduction in curtailed energy through use of redundant paths for power transmission in the network design and that these can in certain cases outweigh the increased capital expenditure associated with their implementation. An investigation into the need case for HVDC circuit breakers is carried out through a comparison with an alternative sectionalised HVDC network topology and the impact on system reliability is found to be negligible in comparison to the cost of the breakers. Offshore network reliability is also found to be highly sensitive to input assumptions for failure and repair rates and the variability within the results was found to be large meaning it could be difficult to accurately predict the reliability of future offshore network implementations. © 2014 CIGRE.

2017,Method for controlling voltage and frequency of the local offshore grid responsible for connecting large offshore commercial wind turbines with the rectifier diode-based HVDC-link applied to an external controller,IET Electric Power Applications,"This study introduces a method for controlling a system that rectifies electric current where power is transferred from several offshore wind power generation systems through a common offshore AC line, into a diode-based bridge. This modular rectifier comprises one or more uncontrolled modules (such as diode rectifiers). According to the study, the wind power supply systems receive a reactive power reference from a central external regulator to maintain the common AC-line frequency. Although there are other control methods for this topology, the proposed external control uses commercial wind turbine with no changes in their internal control. The power plant control systems use their own algorithm to select the active and reactive power reference, maintaining the original wind turbine control unaltered. This method for controlling the voltage and the frequency of local offshore grid allows the operation of the different rectifiers end of the HVDC link.

The harmonic challenges such as sources of harmonic emission and resonances are identified and briefly explained. Also modern remedial harmonic mitigation methods as of active filtering are described and their application in real-life WPP systems demonstrated. It is underlined that WPP components such as widespread medium-voltage cable system and offshore grid transformers can introduce significant low-frequency parallel resonances which can cause a significant harmonic voltage distortion at the point of common coupling.

2013,Alaska's renewables-source ammonia fuel energy storage pilot plant: Toward community energy independence,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,"Alaska's 720,000 people live in over 200 'energy islands' with no electricity grid connection to North America. Smaller communities have no road connection to each other, the rest of Alaska, or the continent. Most energy is imported: diesel for electricity generation and heat; gasoline for local transportation. Fig. 1. All Alaskans might obtain an annually-firm supply of most of their energy, for all purposes, by converting Alaska's diverse, stranded, renewable energy (RE) resources to liquid NH3 fuel, transporting and storing it at low cost in common steel propane tanks, recovering the RE via stationary combined-heat-and-power (CHP) plants, in internal combustion engine (ICE) and combustion turbine (CT) gensets, and via fuel cells, and as transportation fuel. Alaskans could achieve a significant degree of energy independence, and perhaps export our abundant, stranded renewables as 'green' NH3 fuel. © 2013 IEEE."
2012,Extending the reactive compensation range of a direct AC-AC FACTS device for offshore grids,Electric Power Systems Research,"The authors suggest to use hybrid modulation schemes to improve the reactive power compensation capabilities of the direct AC-AC FACTS device composed of a matrix converter and a permanent magnet machine. Because of the intrinsic limitations of the conventional matrix converter modulation schemes, the device has so far displayed a poor reactive power compensation capability when the output power factor is low. Even worse, the direct AC-AC FACTS device could not provide pure reactive power compensation. The paper presents an analysis demonstrating how the hybrid Three-Vector-Scheme extends the reactive compensation range beyond the level that the conventional indirect space vector modulation exhibits. The reactive power compensation capabilities of the FACTS device with both modulations are computed and compared analytically and finally verified by a simulation study. © 2012 Elsevier B.V.

2014,Variability of chlorophyll-a off the southwest coast of India,International Journal of Remote Sensing,"Coastal upwelling off the southwest coast of India during the southwest monsoon is a well-known phenomenon that enhances the chlorophyll-a (chl-a) biomass. The present study explores this property and examines the variability of surface chl-a using satellite data obtained from the Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS) for the period from September 1997 to December 2010. Spatial variability showed substantial cross-shore as well as along-shore gradients during the southwest monsoon. Temporal variability in chl-a was studied in conjunction with satellite observations on sea-surface temperature, sea-surface height anomaly, winds, and currents. The results revealed the dominant influence of the West India Coastal Current on chl-a variability during the upwelling and downwelling periods. Moreover, noticeable intra- and inter-annual variability was observed in the parameter. Therefore, an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) method was used to identify the oscillations influencing variability. SeaWiFS chl-a data for the period 2008-2010 were omitted from this analysis due to gaps in the record. EMD analysis revealed oscillations ranging from seasonal to a five-year periodicity. Quasi-biennial oscillations are identified as the dominant factor causing inter-annual variability in chlorophyll in the study area, compared with the El-Niño Southern Oscillation and Indian Ocean Dipole. Chl-a was also studied in two smaller grids of size 0.5° × 0.5° separated by around 300 km and representing coastal and offshore areas, to understand the nature of variability in these areas. The annual range of variability was high (0.1-8.0 mg m-3) near the coast consequent on high upwelling intensity, and very low (about 0.1 mg m-3) in the offshore grid due to the absence of upwelling. © 2014 Taylor & Francis."
2013,Legal bases for offshore grid development under international and EU law: Why national regimes remain the determining factor,European Law Review,"The development of a transnational offshore grid is under active consideration by the North Sea states. To facilitate a European approach and to trigger the necessary investments, a stable legal framework is needed. This article provides an analysis of the legal bases for offshore grid development under international and EU law. It demonstrates that the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea provides reasonably clear direction for national infrastructure projects offshore, but is less clear regarding transnational projects. Based on this analysis, the article discusses whether the European Union has the legislative competence to establish the requisite regulatory support for the development of a North Sea grid. The article ends with the conclusion that neither international nor EU law provides an adequate legal framework for the development of transnational offshore infrastructure. Consequently, the North Sea states have to take the lead in establishing legal structures to facilitate the co-ordinated development of a European offshore grid. © 2013 Thomson Reuters (Professional) UK Limited and Contributors."
2013,Switching off the generator: Technical and economic approach for storage based renewable energy systems for Islands,WIT Transactions on Ecology and the Environment,"While increasing the share of renewable energy to 20% is a challenge for grid stability, working towards a 100% renewable energy supply requires a completely new approach. Small island grids are the ideal platform to start achieving tomorrow's energy concepts today. To develop the necessary technologies for a high level renewable energy island system, Younicos AG built a hardware and software development and test site in Berlin. The actual system testing shows that the ability to switch off the diesel generator - i.e. guarantee a stable grid exclusively using fluctuating sources and batteries and without rotating masses, gives the freedom to choose any renewable energy configuration between 0 and 100%. Consequently, the renewable energy system layout can be set up according to the island's ecological and economical goals. A hybrid system with a high renewable penetration can generate substantial savings by substituting large shares of fuel for electricity generation. Therefore, in addition to the technological solutions, procedures and business models are being developed to identify the economic optimal configuration for isolated systems under a given set of climate and load conditions. The technical approach, results of the test phase and key parameters of a supply system based on renewables and storage will be summarized in this paper. © 2013 WIT Press."
2011,Wave resource in El Hierro-an island towards energy self-sufficiency,Renewable Energy,"The island of El Hierro (Spain), a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve in the Atlantic Ocean, aims to become the first 100% renewable energy island in the world. With a €54 million wind project already under way, the present research looks at the island's wave resource using a 44-year hindcast dataset obtained through numerical modelling. The geographical distribution of wave energy is examined on the basis of eight study sites around the island. A substantial resource is found west and north of El Hierro, with average wave power in the order of 25 kW m-1 and total annual energy in excess 200 MW h m-1; the resource is less abundant east and south of the island. In addition to these geographical variations, wave energy in El Hierro presents seasonal variations, with energetic winters and mild summers. After analysing the total resource and its spatial and seasonal variations, its composition in terms of sea states (significant wave heights and energy periods) is examined, and how this composition affects the selection of the Wave Energy Converters to be installed is discussed. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
2013,Governing shared offshore electricity infrastructure in the northern seas,International and Comparative Law Quarterly,"Through the joint 'North Seas Countries Offshore Grid Initiative' the states bordering the North Seas are establishing shared large-scale offshore electricity infrastructure in order to exploit their offshore wind energy resources. The article argues that this international governance of oceans space comes about legally because international law, European law and national law each fulfil a specific function. The climate regime provides the normative impetus, the law of the sea allocates competences, and European law contains principles of cooperation, which are then implemented through coordinated national law. International law, European law and national law thus become functionally integrated. This analysis has significance beyond shared offshore electricity infrastructure. It illustrates the way in which the functional integration of international law, European law and national law is emerging as a distinct legal institution in its own right, separate and distinct from the various legal orders themselves. © 2013 British Institute of International and Comparative Law."

2011,The economics of offshore wind,Energy Policy,"This paper presents an overview of the main issues associated with the economics of offshore wind. Investment in offshore wind systems has been growing rapidly throughout Europe, and the technology will be essential in meeting EU targets for renewable energy in 2020. Offshore wind suffers from high installation and connection costs, however, making government support essential. We review various support policies used in Europe, concluding that tender-based feed-in tariff schemes, as used in Denmark, may be best for providing adequate support while minimising developers' rents. It may prove economic to build an international offshore grid connecting wind farms belonging to different countries that are sited close to each other. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd."
2012,Negative sequence current control in wind power plants with VSC-HVDC connection,IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy,Large offshore wind power plants may have multi-MW wind turbine generators (WTG) equipped with full-scale converters (FSC) and voltage source converter (VSC) based high voltage direct-current (HVDC) transmission for grid connection. The power electronic converters in the WTG-FSC and the VSC-HVDC allow fast current control in the offshore grid. This paper presents a method of controlling the negative sequence current injection into the offshore grid from the VSC-HVDC as well as WTG-FSCs. This would minimize the power oscillations and hence reduce the dc voltage overshoots in the VSC-HVDC system as well as in the WTG-FSCs; especially when the offshore grid is unbalanced due to asymmetric faults. The formulation for negative sequence current injection is mathematically derived and then implemented in electromagnetic transients (EMT) simulation model. The simulated results show that the negative sequence current control mitigates the power oscillations and therefore limits the dc voltage excursions in the VSC-HVDC system during the asymmetric faults. © 2012 IEEE.

2012,Consideration of grid stability aspects in the design of offshore wind farms; [Berücksichtigung von netzstabilitätsaspekten bei der planung von offshore-wind parks],VGB PowerTech,"In conventional transmission and distribution grids the frequency power characteristic of grid-connected generators is utilised for controlling the power balance between actual generation and demand. Offshore wind farms which are connected via a high-voltage direct current link to the onshore grid and also use wind turbines with full-scale frequency converters do not possess this physical principle. Therefore additional requirements to frequency converters have to be defined in such grids with a high amount of converters. The special characteristic of offshore grids due to exclusive cabling and the therefore resulting low parallel resonance of the grid impedance have to be attended too. All these points influence the stability of the grid and have to be considered in the planning of offshore wind farms. As the operation of high-voltage direct current connected offshore grids is not yet defined sufficiently, it is urgently needed to coordinate grid and wind farm operators as well as manufacturers of high-voltage direct current links and wind turbines or rather their frequency converters."

The proposed control scheme needs only current and voltage measurements in the wind farm transformer and seeks the maximum power generation using a variable frequency offshore grid, provided by the HVDC-VSC. The work includes an evaluation of the power generated by variable and constant frequency offshore wind farms.

2012,Integrated assessment of combined cooling heating and power systems under different design and management options for residential buildings in Shanghai,Energy and Buildings,"As a well-known technique for rational use of energy, the combined cooling, heating and power (CCHP) system is paid more and more attention in building energy conservation activities. In this paper, the performances of typical CCHP systems are investigated for a high-rise residential building, which is experiencing rapid expansion in China. Based on the building's energy consumption, four types of CCHP technologies have been assumed following three design and management modes, namely, heat tracking mode, electricity tracking mode and energy island mode. In order to have a comprehensive understanding of the performance of the assumed CCHP systems, besides the separated energy, economic and environmental assessments, an integrated assessment framework is proposed. According to the simulation results, gas engine and fuel cell based CCHP systems are feasible options from the energy and environmental viewpoints, but at the cost of poor economic performance. From an integrated viewpoint, the gas engine system is the most attractive option if economic performance is taken into account; otherwise the fuel cell system is the best choice. In addition, the selection of proper design and management mode is of vital importance for the adoption of the CCHP system. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."

2012,Onshore and offshore transmission expansion in the european grid for large scale wind integration in the North Sea,44th International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2012,"The development and implementation of an offshore grid [1] will have wide consequences to the onshore grid and its transmission expansion planning (TEP). A combined TEP for both on- and offshore is strongly necessary for large scale integration of wind energy in Northern Europe. Two TEP methodologies are presented in this paper: The Net-Op tool and the EMPS Investment Analysis Algorithm: i) Net-Op [2] is a transmission expansion planning tool for power systems with large shares of renewable energy sources like e.g. wind. The offshore grid expansion optimization is formulated as a mixed-integer problem and Net-Op explicitly considers the benefit of transmission capacity between different price areas and the value of connecting offshore wind power to the grid versus the investment cost of power cables and auxiliary equipment. The methodology assumes that the locations and installed capacities of the wind farms are known, and finds a solution for the least-cost offshore grid structure and cable dimensioning, taking into account wind power and power demand variations, possible connection points to the shore and an aggregated description of the onshore power system. ii) EMPS (EFI's Multi-area Power market Simulator) is an electricity market model developed by SINTEF [3]. It carries out a system optimization on basis of specified costs and capacities for production, demand and transmission for each area. Hydro power can be represented in detail. The optimization problem is solved by using a combination of stochastic dynamic programming for calculating strategies for hydro power, and linear programming for simulating each weeks and stochastic scenario. A functionality for carrying out investment-analysis has been developed [4]. New capacities are phased in iteratively on basis of simulated prices in the previous simulation. For a transmission line, additional capacity is profitable if the price-differences between two connected areas are sufficiently large. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate how both these tools can be used for TEP in a case study of the North Sea region."
2011,Multi level optimization for offshore grid planning,CIGRE 2011 Bologna Symposium - The Electric Power System of the Future: Integrating Supergrids and Microgrids,"This paper shows an optimization method to determine the best economically and technically feasible transmission topology for connecting multiple offshore wind farms to the main electricity grid. The proposed optimization algorithm determines the connection possibilities with the lowest life cycle system costs. These possibilities are ranked with their total costs and the one with the lowest total costs proposed as the best solution. The optimization algorithm takes only the transmission system into account, which means only between the points of common coupling on the wind farm side and the points of common coupling onshore. Data available in the public domain has been used to validate the methodology. The life cycle system costs consist of investment and maintenance costs for the required transmission equipment, the costs for transmission losses and the costs for possible reinforcements of the existing onshore transmission grid. The optimization algorithm takes both, HVAC and VSC HVDC technologies into consideration. The LCC HVDC technology is not taken into consideration because the large reactive power demands, the big filter installations and the inability to produce an independent rotating electrical field to connect a weak offshore grid. These factors make LCC technology less suitable for offshore applications. AC or DC connections are possible for each potential path of the offshore transmission system, which can result in a hybrid system. The reinforcements of the existing grid can be realized as underground cables or overhead lines, which can significantly impact the life cycle system costs. The proposed optimization algorithm consists of two levels. In the upper level the transmission topology is determined using the coordinates of the offshore wind farms and the possible points of common coupling onshore. The maximal power injections in the offshore grid are used to set the boundary conditions. The transmission technology (HVAC or HVDC) is determined in this level for each corridor of the transmission system. In the lower level optimization, the individual components of the transmission system are refined. In this case the objective function is the total system costs and the optimization constraints are the power ratings of the used equipment. The voltage level of each connection path is determined independently so that multiple voltage levels can exist within the transmission system. The wind energy production profiles of each wind farm are considered with a resolution of one hour. This way the transmission losses can be taken into consideration with a high accuracy during the planning process. The methodology presented offers a completely optimized grid design, including the different components such as cable ratings and types. As such, this result can be used as an ideal first step in the development stages to get realistic estimates of the required investments, grid layouts and equipment. It can form a tool for both the grid developer and the wind farm investor. In the optimization algorithm only radial transmission extensions are considered. To determine the optimal grid layout, only public available cost data and data for equipment ratings are used. The used data in the optimization is validated by applying the algorithm to a number of already existing study cases."
2010,Offshore grids: The Irish view,"IEEE PES General Meeting, PES 2010","Ireland has some of the most favourable wind conditions in the whole of Europe. Wind production, in the mainland as well as offshore, is expected to grow rapidly during the coming years, as evidenced by the fact that some 6000 MW of wind generation is currently awaiting connection to the grid onshore. Given the massive potential for the exploitation of renewable energy resources off the coast of Ireland, i.e. some thousands of MW [1], as well as first requests of connections offshore, it seemed reasonable to develop a study to investigate how to facilitate the connection of this type of generation which is the best topology and which the most viable and cost effective technology. Following a cooperation agreement between EIRGRID and ERSE, a study has been performed by using a Transmission Expansion Planning (TEP) methodology developed by ERSE [2] to evaluate the best network expansion plan aiming at transferring in the Irish Transmission System (ITS), the potential amount of wind energy to be produced offshore in the Irish Sea. ©2010 IEEE."
2012,"Investigating the energy autonomy of very small non-interconnected islands. A case study: Agathonisi, Greece",Energy for Sustainable Development,"Increase in global energy demand, depletion of fossil fuels and environmental issues related to current major power generation patterns have proven to be highly effective drivers for a substantial shift towards renewable energy applications. Renewable energy sources (RES) such as wind, solar and biomass can provide reliable energy services and direct benefits at both national and local levels. Nowadays, in most non-interconnected islands the electricity generation cost is extremely high due to the utilization of outdated autonomous power stations (APSs) based on oil-fuel imports and diesel-electric generators. The objective of the present work is to investigate the possibility of achieving energy autonomy in very small (tiny) islands based exclusively on the use of RES. For that reason, a small Aegean Sea island (i.e. Agathonisi) which faces serious energy and water shortage problems is investigated. The proposed system configuration includes commercial wind turbines, photovoltaic panels, batteries and an internal combustion-electrical generator consuming biogas. The excess electricity is used for fresh water production via sea water desalination. Emphasis is given on a detailed energy analysis being the basis for sustainable development.

This paper includes the study of a control strategy for the islanded operation of the aforementioned wind power plants. The offshore grid voltage is controlled independently of the HVDC link state. Therefore, offshore grid and HVDC link overvoltage due to onshore short circuits are largely reduced. Moreover, the proposed strategy allows for the contribution of the wind power plant to onshore service restoration after a power outage. The proposed control strategy has been validated in a realistic scenario by means of PSCAD/EMTDC simulations. © 2013 IEEE."
2011,Stability analysis of an offshore grid supplied by a HVDC-VSC,EPE Joint Wind Energy and T and D Chapters Seminar,The establishment of offshore AC grids gives the opportunity to connect wind farms and oil platforms within the limited distance of AC cables. Several of these AC grids can be interconnected and connected to shore by a multi-terminal DC grid. In order to supply oil platforms it is important that the offshore AC grid can assure reliable power with acceptable quality. This is analyzed by establishing a conceptual AC grid in the simulation program Simpow. The simulations show that the grid does sustain good power quality as long as the connection to the multi-terminal DC grid is in operation.

2013,Development scenarios for the North and Baltic Seas Grid - A welfare economic analysis,Utilities Policy,"The North and Baltic Seas Grid is one of the largest pan-European infrastructure projects, increasing the potential of harnessing large amounts of renewable energy. This paper addresses the economic implications of different development scenarios of the North and Baltic Seas Grid on individual countries and stakeholders which may raise concerns about the implementation in largely nationally dominated regulatory regimes. The paper develops three scenarios and quantifies the technical-economic effects: i) the status quo, in which engagement in the North and Baltic Seas is largely nationally driven; ii) a trade scenario dominated by bilateral contracts and point-to-point connections; and iii) a meshed network scenario of fully interconnected cables crossing both the North Sea and the Baltic Seas making a truly pan-European infrastructure. We find that in terms of overall welfare, the meshed solution is superior; however, from a distributional perspective there are losers in such a scheme, namely the incumbent electricity generating firms in France, Germany, and Poland, as well as the consumers in low-price countries, e.g. Norway and Sweden. Merchant transmission financing, based on congestion rents only, does not seem to be a sustainable option to provide sufficient network capacities, and authorities will need to mandate the investment in order for it to be made. We also find strong interdependencies between offshore grid expansion and the subsequent onshore network. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

2010,Long-term grid planning in the Netherlands,"43rd International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2010, CIGRE 2010","In the evolving liberal energy market, electricity network planning becomes more and more challenging. Due to the lengthy licensing procedure and the careful preparations required for these procedures, the time to develop and construct long-distance high-voltage lines regulary takes longer than 8-10 years. The time to build facilities that cause changing transport patterns like local combined heat and power plants, wind farms or larger generators is far less. To overcome this discrepancy there is a need for an early picture of potential future developments and of any difficulties that may arise. Investments such as reinforcements and network extensions in a transmission grid usually involve considerable costs and last for several decades. This increases the importance of analysing the long-term development of the electricity demand and supply and examining the consequences for the grid. Wide-ranging developments determine the shape of the future energy landscape. Developments may cancel out or enhance each other, so it is difficult to predict the effects on the demand for electricity transmission. These aspects lead to large uncertainties in the planning process of the electricity transmission networks. Scenario planning is generally used to find the worst case situations the grid must be able to cope with. In this paper, two parameters (sustainability and market development) are examined, which result in four scenarios. The scenarios are not a predictions of the future, but descriptions of different possible future situations. They lead to an exploration of how the Dutch high-voltage onshore and offshore grids may develop between now and 2030. With the information of the scenarios, different future network structures are analysed. This has resulted in a transmission grid concept, anticipating different possible future developments. This concept forms the basis for a clear and coherent long term vision on the development of the onshore and offshore electricity transmission network in the Netherlands. Through a long-term vision for its grid infrastructure, TenneT wants to respond to society's wish to make a transition towards sustainable energy supply while maintaining a high security of supply at reasonable cost. This article describes the development of a long term grid philosophy and the resulting grid concept for both the Dutch transmission grid situation and the integration of offshore wind farms through a North Sea grid."

For example, day-ahead market design could be chosen such that an offshore wind park is affiliated to a national country or placed in a neutral offshore hub. With regard to balancing, an offshore wind park's access to a specific country may be blocked due to interconnector congestion from power trading. Hence, a country's offshore wind park included in an international offshore grid faces a different economic situation than one which is only connected to its home country. It is argued that there is a redistributive effect between offshore wind park income, congestion rents of the interconnectors and necessary support. For a stable investment framework in the near future, a tendering/feed-in tariff may be the best choice. It avoids exposing wind farms to balancing with multiple countries. In the long run, also other support scheme options may be of interest. © 2013 IEEE."
2014,A comparison of design options for offshore HVDC networks through a sequential Monte-Carlo reliability analysis,"European Wind Energy Association Conference and Exhibition 2014, EWEA 2014","There is growing interest in developing offshore HVDC networks to connect both offshore wind power and provide interconnection between regions. There are a number of technology, topology and protection options available to developers each with varying levels of design complexity, capital cost and system redundancy. This paper highlights some of the available options and outlines a methodology for investigating the performance of a number of these through an investigation of their reliability against a lifetime of expected fault conditions, principally through a calculation of the expected level of curtailed energy associated with each network design. A number of case studies are investigated to provide a comparison between options including designs with and without HVDC circuit breakers and with varying levels of interconnection and system redundancy. The paper shows that there are potentially significant benefits in terms of reduction in curtailed energy through use of redundant paths for power transmission in the network design and that these can in certain cases outweigh the increased capital expenditure associated with their implementation. An investigation into the need case for HVDC circuit breakers is carried out through a comparison with an alternative sectionalised HVDC network topology and the impact on system reliability is found to be negligible in comparison to the cost of the breakers. Offshore network reliability is also found to be highly sensitive to input assumptions for failure and repair rates and the variability within the results was found to be large meaning it could be difficult to accurately predict the reliability of future offshore network implementations."
2014,Stability analysis of interconnected AC power systems with multiterminal DC grids based on the Cigré DC grid test system,IET Conference Publications,"This paper presents selected case studies of small-signal stability analysis for power systems consisting of interconnected AC and DC sub-systems. The analysis is based on the Cigré DC-grid test system, which is designed to resemble a generalized future configuration of multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) systems. The small-signal stability of the system is investigated to identify critical modes associated with different parts of the interconnected AC and DC power systems. The analysis is presented in several steps in order to identify interaction problems and critical modes that can occur with different typical system configurations. Firstly, a case with point-to-point HVDC connection is analysed, followed by the analysis of a four-terminal DC system, before the stability of the entire Cigré DC grid configuration is studied. The state variables participating in critical modes, and the parameter sensitivities of these modes are identified and discussed. The obtained results illustrate particular challenges that can occur during a step-wise construction of a large-scale MTDC transmission system."

2012,Assessment of DC/DC converters for use in DC nodes for offshore grids,IET Conference Publications,"With increasing offshore wind generation, there is a strong argument for implementing a multi-terminal DC grid offshore by the interconnection of individual HVDC links. The point of intersection of three or more lines can be used to interconnect projects with different voltage levels and to control power distribution. It is being proposed that these points, or nodes, be implemented using DC devices. A highvoltage, high-power DC/DC converter will therefore be an important component of a DC node. This paper reviews possible DC/DC converter topologies, looking at device requirement, different voltage conversion ratio and fault management. The suitability of the converters considered, for use in a node in a HVDC offshore grid, is discussed. A resonant DC/DC converter topology is considered in detail and is modelled at a conversion ratio of two, and demonstrates high power efficiency."
2013,Topologies of the North Sea Supergrid,Proceedings of the Universities Power Engineering Conference,"The development of the North Sea Supergrid is closely linked to three main topological ideas: (i) Business as Usual; (ii) Local Coordination; and (iii) Fully Integrated. In this paper, the three proposed topologies were simplified, analysed and compared for power export from offshore wind farms unto onshore grids. A review on the state-of-the-art HVAC and HVDC offshore transmission technologies was carried out. The national offshore network development strategies of the six countries surrounding the North Sea were summarised. The number of HVAC and HVDC assets required for all three topologies were calculated. It was evident from calculations that, by 2030, the Fully Integrated Topology will achieve approximately 8% asset savings than the Local Coordination Topology. © 2013 IEEE."
2013,Energy efficiency of grid-connection solutions combining offshore wind power plants and offshore grids,"European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition, EWEC 2013","Commissioning of a huge amount of offshore wind power in the North Sea and Baltic Sea region and establishment of the European-level electricity market will trigger a fast and cost-efficient development within the offshore and onshore grid infrastructures in the region. As expected, the offshore grid will utilize a tried-and-proven High Voltage Alternating Current (HVAC) technology, i.e. using HVAC submarine cables, as well as a relatively new for offshore applications High Voltage Direct Current (HVDC) Voltage-Sourced Converter (VSC) technology, i.e. for large, longdistant energy transmission and connection of asynchronous, onshore HVAC systems. The energy transmission efficiency of the grids is approached through evaluation of the energy transmission losses. High efficiency equals to low losses. This paper studies possible connections between two asynchronous HVAC systems and two offshore wind power plants (OWPP) and evaluates the efficiencies of the grid-connection solutions. The main finding is that offshore grid infrastructures, which combine connections of the onshore systems and OWPP, shall have low energy transmission losses, i.e. high efficiencies, comparing to systems of single point-to-point connectors with the same energy transport capabilities."
2013,Review of the various proposals for the European offshore grid,Renewable Energy,"The integration of large amounts of renewable power, the will to create a single European Energy Market, and the requirements for system adequacy and security of supply are strong drivers towards more electricity interconnection infrastructure in Europe. This is especially true for the European seas with the North Sea in particular. During the last years, various proposals for an offshore grid in Europe have been published in the public domain, varying from research proposals to long-term visions or more concrete projects. Taken up by policymakers and other stakeholders, they have resulted in a number of ongoing initiatives like the Adamowitsch Working Group, the ENTSO-E Regional North Sea Group and the North Seas Countries' Offshore Grid Initiative. The paper provides the background on offshore grids and an extensive overview of the various proposals. Furthermore, the remaining challenges are discussed and explained in the context of the different initiatives. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd."
2012,Testing constraints and opportunities for offshore renewable energy: Strategic development of offshore networks for interconnection and market access,44th International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2012,"The North-West of Europe has particularly rich renewable energy resources, not least in respect of wind, wave and tidal energy around the British Isles. The respective governments have set targets for the realisation of much of the renewable energy potential. However, the transmission networks in those areas are already at or near to their transfer limits in respect of exports of power from the most attractive locations for renewables. Moreover, much of the potential lies offshore and would require considerable investment to be accessed, not only in terms of generation capacity but also in terms of networks. This paper describes the 'Irish-Scottish Links on Energy Study' (ISLES): a collaborative project between the Scottish Government, the Northern Ireland Executive and the Government of Ireland. The project was funded by the three sponsoring executives and the EU's INTERREG IVA Programme under the Special EU Programmes Body (SEUPB). It has assessed the offshore renewables potential off the west coast of Scotland and in the Irish Sea, and reviewed the extent to which differences in the environment and planning frameworks between the three jurisdictions might serve to delay offshore developments. Most particularly, it has considered the feasibility of creating an interconnected offshore transmission network to facilitate access to the renewable energy sources. The network was then analysed to determine the extent to which such an interconnected network, which includes capacity for transfer of energy between the Great Britain (GB) electricity market and the Single Electricity Market (SEM) on the island of Ireland, might enhance the commercial viability of the generation developments. In so doing, a number of important regulatory issues are highlighted that are not particular to ISLES but must be addressed more broadly if European aspirations for offshore grids are to be realised."

2011,Offshore grids: The Irish opportunity,CIGRE 2011 Bologna Symposium - The Electric Power System of the Future: Integrating Supergrids and Microgrids,"In recent years, wind energy, onshore and offshore, has attracted more and more interest as a future resource to be exploited to realise a low carbon emissions environment.Among the drivers for offshore, are the saturation of the best onshore site availability, better public acceptance, and a less variable wind resource. Moreover, in order to attract investment in renewables many countries now offer incentives The potential for Ireland's future integration into European Energy Markets and the export case for offshore wind energy is an economic opportunity. In addition to meeting 40% Renewables by 2020 [1] the offshore integration of renewables with Europe is a further commitment to achieving policy targets and a low carbon environment [2]. With Europe's dependency on gas, this is an opportunity to enhance and build a sustainable, reliable, secure and economic grid for the future. In considering these opportunities a holistic approach is required that aims to ensure that decisions are based on robust quantitative analysis cognisant of the broader policy direction of European regional integration. The island of Ireland has some of the best wind resources worldwide; the offshore grid may represent a great economic opportunity for the country, particularly in a critical period of financial uncertainty. Several synergies may be embedded in an offshore grid deployment strategy that goes beyond the simple task of connecting a wind farm to the mainland, for instance: Enhancement of Energy market competition by greater regional integration of the SEM and BETTA with Europe Potential for an increased ofmarket for'premium' renewable energy Higher utilisation of infrastructure The Single Electricity Market (SEM) operating in Ireland (IE) and Northern Ireland (NI) is continuing to evolve to facilitate the increasing levels of renewable generationto 2020 and beyond. The implementation of Intra Day Trading will increase the opportunities to trade over the existing Moyle Interconnector with Scotland, the East West Interconnector (EWIC) and any further Interconnection between the SEM and neighbouring markets. This paper describes some potential offshore grid deployment strategies in the Irish Sea to 2030 and focuses on the impact of the strategy when subjected to market conditions. Using an expansion planning tool, the optimum infrastructure reinforcement plan to integrate the expected wind resources is calculated over the planning period. A sequential analysis is then performed using a unit commitment based multi regional market model to evaulate the hourly trade across this infrastructure.f Different transmission technologies are assumed according to the geographical distances of the connection points onshore and offshore. Finally, scenarios are selected to compare different technology performances, AC and HVDC, either onshore or offshore. In particular, Multiterminal/Embedded VSC configurations are compared with AC in terms of their impact on the dynamic stability of thetransmission system."
2011,Experimental study on hydrodynamic motion of hybrid type of pontoon,OCEANS 2011 IEEE - Spain,"Recent interest for marine structure is for a floating structure with wide area focused on men's activity such as floating housing complex, energy-island, floating airport, and so on. Pontoon and semi-submersible are the typical types for this purpose. Pontoon is the widely applied offshore floating structure with many advantages of buoyancy, simple details, storage ability, economy, and so on. However it is almost used in nearly still water conditions due to its structural shape. In this study, a new type of pontoon taking advantage of reduced motion was proposed and experimented with a small size specimen. It was a kind of hybrid and had sufficient space for buoyancy like a pontoon and an air-gap which is the characteristic feature of semi-submersible. Even though the hybrid pontoon lost its buoyancy about 16% with compared to that of a pontoon with same weight, it was observed that the motion of the proposed one was more stable than existing ones. © 2011 IEEE."
2012,The economic case for developing HVDC-based networks to maximise renewable energy utilisation across Europe: An advanced stochastic approach to determining the costs and benefits,44th International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2012,"This paper is concerned with the rationale for development of significantly enhanced transmission capacity on a continent scale, in this case in Europe. With a particular emphasis on the accommodation of wind power in the North Sea, it describes an assessment of the extent to which lack of transmission capacity at a European level will act as a constraint to realising Europe-wide targets for electricity from renewable sources in 2020. A plausible generation and demand scenario has been postulated and inter-area power flows studied in a number of network cases for the whole of Europe. The network cases are intended to provide insights into the drivers for different levels of transmission expansion and the different network configurations by which increased transfer capability might be delivered offshore. The analytical methods used take account of realistic time series of available generation including wind and hydro, model spatial correlations of wind and hydro power, minimum stable generation and on and off times, and regionally differentiated reserve requirements. Most particularly, by means of Monte Carlo simulation, the variability of power deficits and surpluses at different locations and flows between locations can be assessed. The analysis is achieved through use of the ANTARES tool developed by RTE. The main metrics used to compare the different scenarios are annual energy production from different types of generator, emissions of carbon dioxide, the total energy from renewables, and the volume of 'spilled' wind energy. The results suggest that new offshore network capacity to allow increased exchange of power between different countries will be important to realising the full potential of new wind power developments. This new network capacity not only allows local surpluses of wind power to be used elsewhere but also facilitates reserve power to be held remote from a particular area and so minimise the total holding of reserve and increase the utilisation of renewable energy. However, it has two further effects: depending on the exact location, it can permit onshore network constraints to be bypassed and, as is shown, it can allow cheap high carbon generation in remote areas to be used instead of lower carbon fossil fuelled plant in a local area. It may thus be concluded that not only are support for investment in very low carbon generation capacity such as wind and development of the transmission network important for reduction of carbon emissions associated with use of electricity, but so too is effective pricing of carbon emissions."
2012,Modeling and optimization of an energy generation island based on renewable technologies and hydrogen storage systems,International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,"The widespread use of renewable energy sources is hindered by their intermittent and unpredictable nature. This problem can be overcome with a storage system which manages the time mismatch between energy production and load requirements. The aim of this work is to develop a simulation tool for evaluating energy and economic performance of renewable energy islands, including various electricity generation technologies (photovoltaic modules, wind turbines and micro-hydroelectric plants), integrated with a hydrogen storage system, comprising an electrolyzer, a hydrogen storage tank and a fuel cell. After a brief description of the simulation tool structure, the attention is focused on energy and economic models of system components. Then an innovative approach for optimizing the energy island is proposed; it is based on a hybrid genetic-simulated annealing algorithm and aims to minimize the unit cost of electricity. Finally a generation island that provides electricity and hydrogen to a farm in central Italy is designed and optimized, comparing configurations based on different renewable technologies. © 2011, Hydrogen Energy Publications, LLC.

2012,Transmission Systems for Offshore Wind Power Plants and Operation Planning Strategies for Offshore Power Systems,"Wind Power in Power Systems, Second Edition","The electric system within an offshore wind power plant and its connection to the main power system pose new challenges to the experts. The best way of interconnecting the wind turbines inside a wind farm has to be found, fulfilling both, redundancy requirements without compromising economic feasibility. The best choice between technologies (HVAC, HVDC - VSC or LCC) for connecting windfarms to shore has to be made, depending on several criteria. The risk of losing this connection versus redundancy has to be economically evaluated. By combining interconnectors and offshore windfarm connections in a modular way, a DC offshore grid can be developed. Anyhow, already during the planning phase the secure operation should be considered thoroughly, because the optimal architecture has to be found, minimizing the necessary assets ensuring secure operation and facilitating later expansion options. The interaction with the onshore grid has to be investigated as well. To enable investigations covering these issues a benchmark offshore test system has been developed which is described in this chapter. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

2012,The effects of meshed offshore grids on offshore wind investment - A real options analysis,"European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition 2012, EWEC 2012","Offshore wind farms in future meshed offshore grids could be subject to different regulatory regimes. Feed-in tariffs would absorb market risk from wind farm operators, whereas price premium mechanisms leave operators exposed to market price signals. In this case, it plays a decisive role which price applies to a node in an offshore grid. The offshore node will either be integrated into any of the neighbouring markets, with access to the respective maximum price, or be subject to separate nodal pricing. We investigate the different regulatory regimes for connections to one to four countries based on a stochastic model capturing uncertainties in prices and line failures. The stochastic analysis shows that in case the wind park is granted access to the respective maximum price, there is a significant option value connected to the operational flexibility of accessing several markets: The wind farm's IRR can increase by up to 33% in the analysed (fictive) cases when connected to four neighbouring countries. Contrarily, in case of nodal pricing, the wind farm will have to cope with IRRs that are up to 15% lower when connected to more than one country. These effects can either hamper adequate investment or lead to windfall profits, if the level of support were not adjusted according to the choice of regulatory regime. This should therefore be considered when designing the regulatory regime and level of support in the offshore grid in order to maintain an effective and efficient development of offshore wind in Europe."
2012,Expansion var planning model in a meshed/mixed AC/DC network,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,"The importance of wind power generation has risen in the last years so much to be considered the most important and affordable renewable energy source with a growing rate faster than other mainstream technologies in the word. Due to the lack of land resources and some environmentalist opposition, the wind strategy is now looking at offshore installations. This requires new criteria to set out the appropriate architecture for future offshore grids. The use of HVAC Cables and LCC (Line Commutated Convertion) and VSC (Voltage Source Conversion) technologies stress the importance of extending the long-term expansion planning to the var support. Coping adequately with the problem of the voltage security assessment in a long-term expansion planning, is the purpose of this work. In this paper a model for the reactive expansion planning is proposed in the presence of a meshed AC/DC grid. © 2012 IEEE."
2013,The coordinated development of offshore energy infrastructure: Legal challenges and possible solutions,Competition and Regulation in Network Industries,"There will be an enormous growth of offshore wind energy generation in the North Sea if current plans are given effect. Standard practice for wind farms constructed to date has been to provide each wind farm with a dedicated cable connection to the onshore transmission system (radial connection). A more efficient approach would be to initiate coordinated projects that involve the clustering of wind farms and consequently allow for shared offshore assets. This could lower the costs and reduce the impacts on the marine environment. However, national regimes currently focus on the installation of radial connections and do not promote the coordinated development of offshore infrastructure. The purpose of this article is to identify the legal barriers to these coordinated projects and to explore what changes could be made to the current regulatory practices of the North Sea states in order to introduce the required coordination between wind energy generation and infrastructure development."
2012,Technology developments and plans to solve operational challenges facilitating the HVDC offshore grid,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,"This paper describes voltage source converter (VSC) offshore technologies for expansion of point-to-point transmission systems to HVDC offshore grids.

New and innovative modular solutions for converter offshore platforms in the gigawatt-range have been developed. As the offshore wind generation increases it makes sense to connect the offshore converters into a multi-terminal grid for better utilization of the transmission systems and connection to balancing power.

2012,Availability analysis of VSC-HVDC schemes for offshore windfarms,IET Conference Publications,"UK Round 3 offshore windfarms located more than 50km from the shore are likely to require a HVDC transmission system. The availability of these HVDC transmission schemes is a key factor in determining if these offshore windfarms are commercially and technically viable. This paper shows that a typical radial HVDC link would have an energy availability of 96.5% based on estimated reliability indices from publically available data and that the submarine cable is the component which has the greatest effect on the scheme's availability. The regional HVDC grid analysed in this paper is shown to have a higher energy availability than an equivalent radial scheme, providing additional capacity is built into the grid. Furthermore, cost-benefit analysis shows the link between a scheme's availability and profitability."

2014,Generalized implementations of piecewise linear control characteristics for multiterminal HVDC,"2014 International Symposium on Power Electronics, Electrical Drives, Automation and Motion, SPEEDAM 2014","Large-scale Multi-Terminal (MT) HVDC grids will require decentralized control schemes where the converters can autonomously react to load changes or disturbances in the dc grid without the need for fast actions of a centralized controller. The majority of such proposed schemes are based on assigning a static Piece-Wise Linear (PWL) characteristic to each converter terminal, which defines a functional dependence between the dc voltage and the local current or power references of the converter. Despite evident conceptual similarities, the various schemes and combinations of control characteristics are presented in literature with different implementations. This paper discusses the possibility for generalized controllers that can reproduce these static characteristics within a single implementation by only modifying parametric settings. In particular two alternative implementations are discussed, whereof the first option has been previously presented but without explicitly discussing its potential for implementing a generalized PWL controller. An alternative implementation is then developed and described in detail, based on a state-machine controlling the operation of a dc-voltage controller. The proposed generalized PWL implementation is demonstrated by numerical simulation of a four terminal HVDC system. © 2014 IEEE."

This factor is even more important in the framework of transnational power exchange which is a way to improve power system operation. In this paper a comparison study has been carried out between two different grid building strategies for offshore wind farms in the North Sea using the 2030 medium wind scenario from the TradeWind project [1]. These strategies are i) radial and ii) meshed grid configuration. The paper has considered active power losses for both strategies and capture the effect of losses on different power system aspects, such as the total soci-economic benefit associated with each strategy, offshore wind power utilization, power exchange between the grid points, grid bottlenecks and utilization of HVDC connections. Using a meshed grid compared to radial there will be a total benefit of 2.7 billion Euro over the economic life time of the grid. However this benefit will be increased by 0.3 billion Euro by taking into account the grid losses for both cases.

2011,Control and operation of wind turbine converters during faults in an offshore wind power plant grid with VSC-HVDC connection,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,"Voltage source converter (VSC) based high voltage dc (HVDC) transmission is an attractive technique for large offshore wind power plants, especially when long cable transmission is required for connection to the onshore grid. New multi-MW wind turbines are likely to be equipped with full scale converters to meet the stringent grid code requirements. In such a scenario, the offshore grid is terminated to the power electronic converters on all the ends. This paper presents a control scheme for the synchronization and control of the grid side converters (GSC) of the wind turbine generators (WTG). Current limit control enables the GSC to sustain the fault currents during short circuits in the offshore wind collector system grid. However, power transmission is affected, and the fault has to be isolated. It can be resynchronized after the fault has been cleared and the breaker reclosed. Healthy WTG converters can remain connected. The scheme is demonstrated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulation. © 2011 IEEE."

2014,Deriving robust design parameters and design criteria for the first offshore artificial island for electricity conversion in the northern north sea,Proceedings of the International Conference on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering - OMAE,"In support of future wind farm developments and to anticipate the intentions to create a European wide smart electricity grid, an offshore high voltage grid in the Belgian North Sea is under development to connect several wind farms to the Belgian onshore electricity grid, called Belgian Offshore Grid (BOG). This grid will contain the first artificial island (AI) to support electricity conversion and transport in the North Sea. The AI will be part of an offshore high voltage grid that shall connect a number of offshore wind farms to an onshore high voltage station. An accurate definition of site conditions and design criteria is of utmost importance for the design, operability and exploitation of the island and is the main driver for the cost of such islands. Deriving robust, but not over conservative site conditions and appropriate design criteria was one of the first challenges for the project. Based on in-situ measurements of geotechnical, geophysical and met-ocean conditions design parameters have been derived together with design criteria. This paper focuses on the methods and numerical models used to define the appropriate design input and the sensitivity analysis of the design criteria. In order to derive robust but not over conservative design parameters not only in-situ measurements are required, but also a combination of statistical analysis, numerical models and sensitivity analysis of design criteria and functional requirements. One of the driving design criteria for such works is the allowable overtopping discharge and related hydrodynamic forces on the infrastructure on the island, which largely influences the cost.

2012,Impact of reserve market integration on the value of the North Sea offshore grid alternatives,"9th International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM 12","Expected large scale integration of offshore wind power in the North Sea in future scenarios, 2020-2030, contribute to challenges on transmission planning and system operation in the Northern European electricity network. Moreover, the intermittency of the renewable resources makes the operational planning, forecasting, balancing, and control of the system more challenging. In this paper, a comparison is carried out between two reserve procurement market models. This is done by simulating non- and fully-integrated Northern European market using a 2030 scenario in combination with the effect of two different strategies for the development of the North Sea offshore grid: Radial grid and Meshed grid. The day-ahead market is modeled as a common market on an aggregate level for the whole European continent. Reserve procurement is done simultaneously with the clearing of the day-ahead market. For the analysis of day-ahead dispatch, a DC optimal power flow is used. The results show that about EUR 262 million and EUR 326 million per year could be saved as a result of the integration of the Northern European reserve market for the meshed and radial offshore grid topologies respectively. © 2012 IEEE."

Nowadays, wind technology is looking at offshore installations, due to the both lack of land resources and environmentalist opposition.

2013,Governing a North Sea grid development: The need for a regional framework treaty,Competition and Regulation in Network Industries,"The North Sea coastal states are exploring the possibility of collaborating on the development of cables for transmitting electricity in waters subject to their jurisdiction with a view to creating an offshore grid. I argue in this article that they should support their political resolution, if they agree to proceed with this initiative, by entering into a treaty that governs the expansion of electricity infrastructure in the marine region. A legal framework is required because of the significant potential for the complex process that would be involved with the formation of a regional grid to depart from an optimal course for advancing the North Sea states' shared goals of providing the infrastructure needed for decarbonising their energy supplies whilst maintaining energy security at least cost. A framework treaty would enhance their ability to set and keep the development of transmission networks in the North Sea on a pathway that leads to mutually beneficial outcomes."
2012,VIAvento - A fast and accurate simulation tool for power-electronic systems,EPE Joint Wind Energy and T and D Chapters Seminar,Simulating complex offshore grids including connected devices and independent control algorithms (e.g. in DLL form) is essential for the assessment of global system stability. In power-electronic applications - due to independently controlled and independently switching inverters - only time domain simulation can give meaningful results.

The functioning of this tool is illustrated by showing simulation results of connected two-point converters and one HVDC in modular-multilevel-converter topology (MMC topology).
2012,Transmission system topology optimization for large-scale offshore wind integration,IEEE Transactions on Sustainable Energy,"A method to determine the optimal transmission system topology for multiple offshore wind farms is introduced using a rule-based generic algorithm. The methodology is implemented as a software tool determining the best economical and technically feasible offshore transmission solution. The optimization algorithm takes radial, ring shaped, and meshed transmission topologies into consideration. Besides the investments for the offshore grid also new connections or reinforcements in the existing onshore grid are proposed by the algorithm. The developed tool delivers a set of transmission system topologies ranked after their life cycle system costs with their corresponding transmission voltage and technology (HVAC or HVDC), the necessary transmission equipment, and its rating. The optimization results are based on publicly available data. The achieved results are compared with other studies and validated.

The analysis is done with the help of both market simulations and load flow calculations. The round-the-year security analysis is used to evaluate different offshore grid structures and the interdependencies that exist between grid structure and available capacity for market transactions. Grid security, grid utilization factors, operating costs (fuel and emissions) and wind curtailment are considered in the assessment. Furthermore, the same round-the-year security analysis is used to investigate the effects of the offshore grid on the security of the Dutch onshore grid.

The European policy and legal framework is used to illustrate how this new technology, international electricity market integration, and the distribution of wind and solar natural resources lead to the need for continent-wide internationally coordinated network planning with a view on long-term greenhouse gas reduction. First, the technical and economic aspects of UHV transmission are described, including, e.g., converter configurations and internal and external insulation. Then, UHV transmission is put into the context of other broad current questions of power system development: AC and DC, microgrids, smart grids, power electronics, overhead lines, cables, and gas-insulated lines. The final part discusses the European legal framework for climate protection and for transmission system operator (TSO) cooperation in the new, legally mandated European transmission system operator association ENTSO-E, in particular for joint European grid planning and for R&D. This example shows how UHV technology development can contribute to market integration and economic and environmental goals for continent-wide and internationally coordinated transmission development as one option in international long-term system studies. © 2006 IEEE."
2011,A technology challenge: The case of Ireland,CIGRE 2011 Bologna Symposium - The Electric Power System of the Future: Integrating Supergrids and Microgrids,"The directive on the promotion of the use of renewable energy resources published by the European Commission in 2008 has given further impetus to the development of Europe's wind energy resources. As at the end of 2010, approximately 1400 MW of wind generation had been installed in the Republic of Ireland, roughly 25 MW of which comes in the form of off-shore plant. Given that Ireland has some of the most favourable wind conditions in the whole of Europe, wind farm development in and off the coast is expected to grow rapidly over the coming years, as evidenced by the fact that some 6,000 MW of wind generation is currently awaiting connection to the grid. Furthermore recent Government Targets in the framework of ""20-20-20"" EU initiative, set for ROI a challenging 40% of Renewable Energy for 2020. This large amount and nature of Wind Resources is challenging the Transmission System Operator, Eirgrid, as to how to guarantee the connection and to integrate the incoming vast Wind resources in the present Transmission Grid. Large investments have already been planned onshore to accommodate some 5000 MW of wind farms, in the framework of the strategic development plan GDS 25. Recent advancements in the strategic plan have drawn attention to the offshore landscape, where some stakeholders have already obtained rights to installation tens of kilometres off the east coast of the country. Eirgrid is therefore undertaking a thorough and comprehensive investigation into how an offshore grid must be designed and which Transmission technologies are available today and in the future for the overall strategic deployment plan. The paper describes to which extent technology could provide the TSO flexibility in the decision making process to the ultimate objective of a technical efficient and cost effective designed solution. In particular the potential of a mixed AC/DC network structure may impose decision at the very beginning of the investment plan which may turn out in different results in the long term perspectives. At this stage, the selection of the proper Transmission Technology may mitigate the planner dilemma of large initial investment in the long term versus small investments in a shorter term Results of a study case of the Irish transmission network in the North-Sea context, showing Offshore Grid results and comparison of system performances are shown."

2012,Where is the ideal location for a US East Coast offshore grid?,Geophysical Research Letters,"This paper identifies the location of an ""ideal"" offshore wind energy (OWE) grid on the U.S. East Coast that would (1) provide the highest overall and peak-time summer capacity factor, (2) use bottom-mounted turbine foundations (depth 50 m), (3) connect regional transmissions grids from New England to the Mid-Atlantic, and (4) have a smoothed power output, reduced hourly ramp rates and hours of zero power. Hourly, high-resolution mesoscale weather model data from 2006-2010 were used to approximate wind farm output. The offshore grid was located in the waters from Long Island, New York to the Georges Bank, ≈450 km east. Twelve candidate 500 MW wind farms were located randomly throughout that region. Four wind farms (2000 MW total capacity) were selected for their synergistic meteorological characteristics that reduced offshore grid variability. Sites likely to have sea breezes helped increase the grid capacity factor during peak time in the spring and summer months. Sites far offshore, dominated by powerful synoptic-scale storms, were included for their generally higher but more variable power output. By interconnecting all 4 farms via an offshore grid versus 4 individual interconnections, power was smoothed, the no-power events were reduced from 9% to 4%, and the combined capacity factor was 48% (gross). By interconnecting offshore wind energy farms ≈450 km apart, in regions with offshore wind energy resources driven by both synoptic-scale storms and mesoscale sea breezes, substantial reductions in low/no-power hours and hourly ramp rates can be made.

2012,The European North Seas Countries' Offshore Grid initiative the way forward,IEEE Power and Energy Society General Meeting,"In Europe, a large amount of offshore wind power is expected to be built. Today, there is about 3,5 GW of offshore wind power capacity installed, and potential has been identified to an increase to 150 GW on-and offshore wind power by 2030. About half of European offshore wind is expected to be built in the North Seas, about 60-80 GW by 2030. Some of the sites will be far from shore, requiring the use of long DC subsea cables to connect them with the onshore power systems. Additionally, Europe is aiming for increased integration of the power markets by expanding international power exchange capacity. There is a potential for these developments to merge by combining offshore wind power grid connection and interconnectors between European member states by the establishment of an offshore grid. The North Seas Countries' Offshore Grid initiative was formed as the responsible body to first investigate barriers and propose solutions to the 10 countries' ministers, who will then decide on the way forward.

In this scenario, a pan-European offshore grid network is needed in order to efficiently integrate large amounts of offshore wind into the different European countries' transmission networks. In this paper, the dynamic model of a multi-terminal HVDC (MTDC) transmission system composed of voltage-source converters is presented. Afterwards, the dynamic models are used to compare four different methods for controlling the DC voltage inside MTDC networks, viz.: droop control, ratio control, priority control and voltage margin method. Lastly, a case study is performed in a fournode MTDC network and the different control strategies are compared during steady-state and an onshore three-phase fault."
2011,All year power supply with off-grid photovoltaic system and clean seasonal power storage,Solar Energy,"The objective of the project is an all-year secure supply of alternating current based on a solar energy island grid consisting of serial components and seasonal energy storage. Photovoltaic modules, inverters, electrolysers, batteries, hydrogen stores and fuel cells form the basis of the independent power supply system. For this, selected load profiles were analysed and evaluated in theory and practice.The analysis is based on the results of the test runs of the system and the simulations, in which the combined hydrogen-battery-system is compared to the battery system.It was revealed that it is sensible to complement an island grid operating on lead batteries for shortterm energy supply with hydrogen as a long-term store. This ensures a year-round supply security based on solar energy and the extension of the life span of the batteries required for hydrogen-based power stores. The systems based purely on batteries can not provide perfect supply security during long periods of low solar radiation since they do not possess energy stores which allow long-term energy storage.Hence a seasonal energy store, such as hydrogen, is required to guarantee reliable power supply for every day of the year.Autonomous power supply systems with long-term energy stores operate independently from the public grid system and can be implemented without elaborate intelligent energy management. For this, however, the costs of the serial components must be reduced and the efficiency of the system must be improved. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd."
2012,Challenges in energy systems for the smart-cities of the future,"2012 IEEE International Energy Conference and Exhibition, ENERGYCON 2012","In the last years the European Union has actively promoted the renewable energies and the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) also for residential and tertiary buildings. The exploitation of renewable sources and cogeneration seems hampered by the regulatory wall that prohibit for residential, tertiary and commercial buildings the constitution of users clusters. In fact, the unification up to a threshold value of some tens of kVA, at least, can facilitate the installation of renewable energy power plants as solar PV modules or CHP systems (cogeneration) or CCHP systems (tri-generation), overcoming technical and economical barriers and combining several load profiles. The actual distribution system for low voltage LV customers appears inadequate to comply with these goals. At this aim the authors propose the design of a Sustainable Energy Microsystem (SEM) for the integration of different subsystems, currently independent, as final users and high efficiency buildings, dispersed generation from renewable and Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units and subsystems for the urban mobility: metro-transit, trams and recharging of plug-in hybrid and electric vehicles (PHEV) for the surface mobility. The integration is analyzed in the direction of a smart city concept, with the optimized and integrated management of many services. These activities are about the general topic of design and construction of nearly zero energy buildings with the use of innovative technologies as home and building automation. The buildings integrated in energy hub with dispersed generation and urban mobility systems, constitute the energy islands of the future smart grid. © 2012 IEEE."
2010,First steps in developing a future north-sea offshore grid,"European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition 2010, EWEC 2010","Several concepts of offshore power systems have recently been discussed. The further realisation of these systems requires comprehensive computation studies to find optimal technical network solutions. Generally, the AC technique will be applied for electrical energy transmission. However, the current studies show that in practice two concepts will additionally be applied, classic HVDC technology - especially for sea cable interconnection of countries - and VSC HVDC technology - especially for offshore-interconnection of wind parks. The choice of the connection-to-shore technology for offshore wind farms will generally depend on the distance to shore. For wind farms placed close to shore, such as in Denmark, AC cables are used as is already the case for both operating wind farms Horns Rev I and Horns Rev II. For the wind farms placed far from the coast the alternative voltage source converter based high voltage direct current transmission technology may be applied. This will e.g. happen in the case of many German wind farms, as is already realized by the German transmission system operator Transpower for the 400 MW large BorWin1 farm in the North Sea. In this paper the chosen aspects of planning and analysing such a mixed AC-DC offshore / onshore power system will be discussed. Based on a defined test system some study cases will be carried out and evaluated in order to demonstrate the complexity of the planned systems and point out some operational issues that need to be considered in the planning phase."
2012,Challenges and rationale for laboratory research of offshore grids,Energy Procedia,"Offshore power systems will be characterized by a large penetration of power electronics converters and power cables, resulting in complex behaviors that can be quite different from traditional AC systems. Analyzing such systems is challenging due to their complexity and the relative lack of experience. In this context, performing laboratory tests in scaled down model network have significant relevance to verify simulation models and to test equipment and control methods in a controlled environment. The design of the laboratory needs to be a compromise between the capability to accurately reproduce the real system behavior and the practical constraints on ease of use, equipment size, cost and safety. This paper summarizes the main design considerations for a laboratory infrastructure dedicated to research of future offshore grids and the possible challenges.

2013,The need for a common standard for voltage levels of HVDC VSC technology,Energy Policy,"The expansion of offshore wind energy as well as the increase in electricity trade between the North Sea countries leads to a growing need for additional transmission capacity. Due to the predominantly remote locations of offshore wind farms, the majority of future connections will be high-voltage direct current (HVDC) connections. In order to make the construction of offshore infrastructure more efficient, the North Sea states are currently discussing the development of a common offshore grid. Although this development still stands at the very beginning, we argue in this paper that some crucial elements should be standardized from the outset; the most important one being a common voltage level. Without such standardization, the development of a European offshore grid may be suboptimal, not cost-efficient and might even be prevented from coming into existence. We examine the technical and legal issues associated with introducing a common voltage level for the use of HVDC VSC technology, and discuss the optimal standard as well as the way in which this common standard can best be achieved. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd."

The upper bound on stator power flow is suitably set to allow an overload manageable for an electromechanical machine. The Central Optimizer procedure is followed by a Local one modifying (in dependence to real time measured wind speed) the optimization variables for each generators, taking constant the AC offshore grid frequency at the value previously found by the Central Optimizer.

The system is analysed by means of simulations and experimentally in a down-scaled laboratory model with ratings in the range of 60 kVA. In order to evaluate the robustness of the droop-control strategy, several large disturbances are emulated: abrupt variation in wind production, sudden change in droop line set-points and loss of two converter terminals during full wind production.

2011,"The European offshore supergrid and the expansion of offshore wind energy in Germany, Ireland and the United Kingdom - legal, political and practical challenges",European Energy and Environmental Law Review,"The intention of this paper is to provide an up to date overview of the key legal, political and practical challenges arising from the proposal by Airtricity/ Mainstream Renewable Power to construct a European offshore Supergrid, a super-structure of interconnected HVDC subsea electricity networks designed to span the coastal regions of the European continent. The paper takes a multi-disciplinary and comparative approach of the legal and policy positions in three core European offshore wind energy markets and is motivated by a firm belief that the Supergrid is an ""achievable"" energy infrastructure project. Two central objectives of the Europe Union's energy policy are rooted in the Supergrid proposal. In the first instance, the Supergrid would enhance the expansion of renewable electricity generation in Europe, thus acting as an implementation tool for the European Union's climate change obligations. At the same time, the proposal would also contribute to the achievement of the union's triple energy policy goals: Emission reductions, energy security and technical competitiveness. In its second capacity, by developing an interconnected offshore grid network, the Supergrid would duplicate the congested European onshore grid and serve as a vast interconnector between energy markets. By enabling for the first time the genuine competitive trading of electricity across the union's borders, the proposal would considerably contribute to the achievement of the single European electricity market."
2012,Coordinated control of series-connected offshore wind park based on matrix converters,Wind Energy,"Optimization and reliability are two important aspects in design and operation of wind parks either for offshore as for onland emplacements. However, offshore locations demand conscientious effort in optimizing the size and the weight of each component in the energy conversion system because of the high investment and maintenance costs related with the supporting structures and transportation respectively. Achieving these two objectives requires the combination of different optimization stages, which consider a suitable design of the entire conversion system with innovative and more efficient power electronic devices, optimized topology of the offshore grid and customized control strategies for optimizing the operation of the park. This paper presents an energy conversion concept for wind turbines on the basis of a reduced matrix converter (RMC) that will enable series direct current architecture in offshore wind parks thus preventing the need for offshore platforms. The RMC is built with bidirectional semiconductors that give reduced losses because of both superior topology and more efficient semiconductors. The proposed conversion topology is tested in stationary state and transient operation. In addition to operational features of the concept, control and operation of a wind park with several turbines are presented. Dynamic operation of the turbine as well as the high-voltage direct current transmission line effects are considered. Three types of models are therefore developed. First, an accurate and detailed model for analyzing one single turbine with the converter operated at high-frequency switching is presented. This model considers a new modulation for the RMC. A second and simpliienfed model is used for small signal analysis. This model permits to simulate several series-connected cluster during transient. Finally, an optimal direct current load flow model is used for evaluating stationary state operation. Results show the technical feasibility of the proposed concept and their advantages over conventional topologies. The paper also discusses the technological challenges that this type of offshore grid architecture will bring. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

1981,Arangement for concentrating sea waves.,,Describes a system for concentrating water wave energy comprising an offshore grid-like arrangement to transfer substantially rectilinear fronts of incident water waves into substantially arch-like water wave fronts with concentrated wave energy in a common central area spaced from the grid-like arrangement.
1995,Aliphatic Phenylene Vinylene Copolymers: Tuning the Color of Luminescence through Co-monomer Feed Ratios,Journal of the American Chemical Society,"By introducing co-monomers with flexible linker groups into a step growth condensation route to poly-(phenylene-alt-vinylene) (PPV), a series of solution-processible PPV copolymers is prepared. Peak photoluminescence of these copolymers systematically ranges from about 2.25 to 2.75 eV (yellow-green to blue), increasing in energy upon increasing flexible linker content. Length of the linker group does not significantly alter spectral properties but does influence solubility and film morphology. The statistical distribution of phenylene vinylene segments along the copolymer backbone is discussed in the context of the optical profiles expected. Quantitative quenching of the luminescence for the shortest phenylene vinylene segments strongly indicates that crossover of excited states is occurring. The trapping and recombination of these excited states is occurring on lower-energy “islands”, confirmed to be the longer phenylene vinylene segments, which serve as ideal recombination sites for photogenerated species. © 1995, American Chemical Society.

1998,Simulation of the effect of anisotropic grain boundary mobility and energy on abnormal grain growth,Journal of Materials Science,"Abnormal grain growth (AGG) can take place when the grain boundaries of a given grain have the growth advantage exclusively over those of the other grains. The growth advantage can be provided either by high mobility or by low energy of the grain boundaries. Monte Carlo simulation is done to determine which of the two factors is more important in inducing AGG. The results of the simulation indicate that the growth advantage by the low energy induces AGG under a more realistic condition if the grain boundary energy is low enough to allow the AGG grain to grow by solid-state wetting. Grain growth by wetting will take place at the triple junction when the sum of the two grain boundary energies is smaller than the other grain boundary energy. Island grains inside the AGG grain are formed both by anisotropic mobility and energy of grain boundaries. High frequency of island grains, however, comparable to that observed in the initial stage of AGG in an Fe-3%Si alloy, is induced under a condition where growth by wetting is favored while the grain boundary migration is suppressed. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers."

2009,Design and performance evaluation of a trigeneration system incorporating hydraulic storage and an inverted Brayton cycle,Journal of Engineering for Gas Turbines and Power,"To bring the economic benefit of trigeneration to small-scale users without incorporating expensive components, an inverted Brayton cycle (IBC) is employed, which makes use of the expander section already present in a microturbine. An air accumulator provides pressurized air, which is passed through the expander section of the same microturbine used to charge the accumulator. The air passing through the IBC is cooled due to expansion, simultaneously providing power and cooling the flow. As the microturbine is indirectly fired, the flow passing through the engine or IBC can be directly vented into the household-eliminating the need for additional heat exchangers. The size of the cycle studied is on the order of 10 Kw(e), suitable for a domestic household; however, the system is easily scaled for larger commercial applications. The majority of the components in the system being studied are ""off the shelf"" products. A feasibility study was conducted to ensure that the proposed system is economically competitive with systems currently used, such as individual generation provided by an air conditioner (A/C), a high efficiency natural gas (NG) furnace, and grid power. Simulations were run for a full year based on the actual external temperature and the electrical and thermal loads for a single family detached dwelling located in Winnipeg, Canada. Performance data were generated using MATLAB™ while the economic performance was determined with timebased simulations conducted using SIMULINK™. The system is designed to allow energy islanding by providing for all household energy needs throughout the year; however, integration with a power grid is optional. It was found that the operating costs for the proposed trigeneration system in an energy islanding mode of operation were equivalent to or less than individual generation (A/C unit, NG furnace, and grid power) during heating modes of operation and were more expensive for cooling modes of operation. The yearly energy cost for the trigeneration system exceeded the individual generation costs by 30-40%; however, there remains much room for improvement to the trigeneration concept. All economic data were based on fair market energy prices as found in central Canada. © 2009 by ASME."
1998,Photosynthetic parameters and empirical modelling of primary production: A case study on the Antarctic Peninsula shelf,Antarctic Science,"Eight hundred photosynthesis-irradiance relationships were determined in the shelf waters adjacent to Palmer Station, Antarctica during the spring/summer periods of 1991-94. Biomass specific maximum photosynthetic rate, P(B)(max), and the light limited photosynthetic efficiency, α(B), were poorly correlated to the physical forcing and nutrient regimes at the sampling stations. The two photosynthetic parameters, however, did strongly covary indicating the minimum irradiance required to saturate photosynthesis, I(k), was relatively constant in this highly variable environment. The variability in I(k) could partially be attributed to both depth in the water column and time of the year, with the highest values occurring for surface samples during the summer period of peak incident irradiance. Given this and the significant dependence of P(max) on phytoplankton biomass, a simple empirical model for primary productivity was developed. An independent test of the model was performed on data collected in a mesoscale offshore grid and predicted primary production was found to be within 13% of measured values. Although there are limitations to this approach (i.e. exclusion of diel periodicity in photosynthetic response), these results provide relatively robust estimates of daily primary production for the Southern Ocean."
2008,Advanced fault management as a part of smart grid solution,IET Seminar Digest,"Concept of advanced fault management as a part of the Smart Grid solution is based on full coordination of local automation, locally controlled switchgear and relay protection with maximum exploitation for minimizing fault duration and undelivered energy. Island operation is proposed as possible solution for energization of important consumers in order to maximally protect such consumers from outages. All considerations are elaborated trough examples. Also some ideas for further improvements are also suggested."
1976,SYMBIOTIC NUCLEAR ENERGY PARK AS THE ULTIMATE PRIMARY ENERGY SOURCE FOR SWITZERLAND - GENESIS AND RATIONALE.,,"An optimum nuclear reactor strategy towards a long-range energy independence for Switzerland is described. The potential reactor family, consisting exclusively of Fast Breeder Reactors (FBR) and various High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactors (HTGR's), are supposedly assembled as an underground nuclear energy park in a mountain of the Alps, called an ″Energy Mountain″ , in analogy to an ″Energy Island″ . The main feature of the symbiotic reactor system is the coupled fuel cycle which will then permit practically a uranium-ore-and separative-work-independent energy economy. It is shown that the amount of natural uranium and thorium which is necessary to feed the system in equilibrium can be effectively extracted from granite of the Swiss Alps where an abundant amount of these rocks is available having a content of 80-100 ppm uranium and thorium with the required ratio of U to Th. The whole system is considered to be the ultimate primary energy source of an all entropy energy economy based upon clean and wasteless secondary energy carriers like electricity, hydrogen for industry, synthesis gases (H//2 plus CO) for metal reducing complexes and methanol production, ″Adam-Eva″ heat for long distance ( greater than 50 km) process heat applications, electricity generation and district heating, and hot water for district heating in the vicinity ( less than 50 km) of the park. It is concluded that even a country like Switzerland, without any fossil resources at all, may have optimistic long-range perspectives with respect to the question of energy dependence."
2010,Analysis of grid alternatives for North Sea offshore wind farms using a flow-based market model,"2010 7th International Conference on the European Energy Market, EEM 2010","Offshore wind farms are gradually being planned and built farther from the shore. The increased integration of wind power, also onshore, and the demand for improved power system operation give rise to a growing need for transnational power exchanges. Grid connection is a critical factor for successful large scale integration of offshore wind power. In this paper a comparison study between two different grid building strategies for offshore wind farms in the North Sea is presented for the 2030 medium wind scenario of the TradeWind project [1] (302 GW installed wind capacity). These two strategies are: i) A strategy based on radial wind farm connections to shore and point-to-point interconnections between countries, called radial grid; ii) A strategy based on the use of offshore nodes to build an HVDC offshore grid, called offshore grid. The comparison addresses different power system aspects, such as the total socio-economic benefit associated with each strategy, power exchanges between countries, offshore wind power utilization, grid congestions and utilization of HVDC cable capacity. We find that the offshore grid gives a total benefit over the economic lifetime of the grid for the European interconnected power system of 2.6 billion Euro compared with the radial grid. Our results show that even for moderate amounts of installed wind capacity, the offshore grid strategy is better than the radial one, assuming the future European power system will have a large penetration of offshore and onshore wind power. © 2010 IEEE."
2009,The prevalence of molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) in a group of children in a highly polluted urban region and a windfarm-green energy island,International Journal of Paediatric Dentistry,"Backround: Children's developing teeth may be sensitive to environmental pollutants such as polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans. The term molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) was introduced to describe the clinical appearance of enamel hypomineralization of systemic origin affecting one or more permanent first molars (PFMs) that are associated frequently with affected incisors. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalance of MIH in children from the most industrialized and polluted region and the most green-energy island of Turkey. Design. In September 2007, a retrospective study was initiated in two elementary schools: one, a group of children (N = 153) who fitted the criteria from Tavsancil, Kocaeli (N = 109) and the other from Bozcaada island, Canakkale (N = 44). The soil samples were collected from selected regions in order to determine the contamination levels in a heavily industrialized area and a non-industrialized area. Results: Prevalance of MIH in children in Bozcaada island was 9.1%, while prevalance of MIH was 9.2% in Tavsancil. The PCDD/F levels in soil samples collected from Bozcaada and Tavsancil were determined as 1,12 and 8,4 I-TEQ ng/kg dry soil, respectively (P < 0.001). Conclusions: In this preliminary study with a small study population, prevalence of MIH did not seem to be associated with the levels of PCDD/Fs in the environment. © 2008 BSPD, IAPD and Blackwell Publishing Ltd."
2008,"Palmer LTER: Patterns of distribution of five dominant zooplankton species in the epipelagic zone west of the Antarctic Peninsula, 1993-2004",Deep-Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography,"Variability in the temporal-spatial distribution and abundance of zooplankton was documented each summer on the Palmer Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) grid west of the Antarctic Peninsula between Anvers and Adelaide Islands during a 12-yr time series. Oblique tows to 120 m with a 2×2 m fixed-frame net were made at about 50 stations each January/February between 1993 and 2004. The numerically dominant macro- and mesozooplanktonic species >2 mm included three species of euphausiids (Euphausia superba, Antarctic krill; Thysanoëssa macrura; Euphausia crystallorophias, ice krill), a shelled pteropod (Limacina helicina), and a salp (Salpa thompsoni). Life cycles, life spans, and habitat varied among these species. Abundance data from each year were allocated to 100 km by 20 km (alongshore by on/offshore) grid cells centered on cardinal transect lines and stations within the Palmer LTER grid. The long-term mean or climatology and means for each year were used to calculate annual anomalies across the grid. Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to analyze for patterns and trends in the temporal-spatial variability of the five species. Questions included whether there are groups of species with similar patterns, and whether population cycles, species interactions or seasonal sea-ice parameters were correlated with detected patterns. Patterns in the climatology were distinct, and matched those of physical parameters. Common features included higher abundance in the north than in the south, independent of the cross-shelf gradients, and cross-shelf gradients with higher abundance either inshore (E. crystallorophias) or offshore (S. thompsoni). Anomalies revealed either cycles in the population, as episodic recruitment in Antarctic krill, or changes in anomaly pattern between the first and second half of the sampling period. The 1998 year, which coincided with a rapid change from a negative to a positive phase in the SOI, emerged as a year with either significant anomalies or that marked a change in anomaly patterns for different species. PCA analysis showed that the pattern of cumulative variance with increasing number of modes was distinctly different for shorter-lived versus longer-lived species; the first mode accounted for nearly 50% of the variance in the shorter-lived species and less than 25% in the longer-lived species. This suggested that the mechanisms driving variability in the temporal-spatial distribution of the shorter-lived, more oceanic species were less complex and more direct than those for the longer-lived euphausiids. Evidence from both the anomaly plots and the trend analysis suggested that salps have been more consistently present across the shelf from 1999 to present, and that the range of L. helicina has been expanding. With shorter life spans, these two species can respond more quickly to the increasing heat content on the shelf in this region. The cross-correlation analysis illustrated the negative correlation between salps and ice retreat and the number of ice days, and the positive correlation between the presence of ice krill and the day of ice retreat. These results suggest that for these species, several environmental controls on distribution and abundance were linked to seasonal sea-ice dynamics. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
2009,Optimal design of subsea grid for offshore wind farms and transnational power exchange,"European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition 2009, EWEC 2009","Large-scale development of offshore wind power is needed to fulfil Europe's future electricity needs and for reducing emissions from the electricity sector. Grid connection is a critical factor that should be regarded in accordance with the need for increased transnational power exchange to avoid sub-optimal offshore grid developments. This paper presents a methodology for identifying an optimum offshore grid structure, taking into account wind variations, price variations, power demand at oil rigs, and possible connection points to the onshore power system. The applicability of the method is demonstrated by a case study of offshore wind power development in Norway."
2010,Analysis and design of an offshore wind farm using a MV DC grid,IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery,"This paper outlines the design of an offshore wind farm using a dc offshore grid based on resonant dc-dc converters. Multiphase resonant dc-dc converters are studied to step up the dc voltage from individual wind generators to a Medium Voltage (MV) dc bus, and from the MV bus to an HVDC line that will connect the wind farm to shore. Compared to an equivalent ac grid-based wind farm, a dc grid-based wind farm has slightly higher losses, but the weight of the magnetic components and cables is substantially lower. The analysis of operating permanent-magnet synchronous generators at variable and constant dc voltages shows that a fixed dc voltage has marginally higher efficiency than a variable dc voltage. However, using a variable dc voltage gives lower harmonics at the generator facing the voltage-source converter and the dc-dc step-up converter. An aggregated model of multiple parallel connected wind generators is developed and shown to accurately approximate a detailed PSCAD model during varying wind conditions and transients. © 2010 IEEE."
2007,Grid frequency control for LCC HVDC link connected wind farms,IECON Proceedings (Industrial Electronics Conference),In this paper we consider the design for the offshore grid frequency control in a DFIG-based wind farm with LCC HVDC link connection. The control approach is based on using the grid frequency to regulate the HVDC DC-link current and hence control the power flow in the system. The dynamic equations are derived and grid frequency controller is designed. The mathematical analysis and the control design are verified through FSCAD simulations. Good modelling agreements are obtained for the closed loop system and the work provides a good basis for wider research investigation into wind farm operation. ©2007 IEEE.
2007,The Isle of energy: Storing power at sea,PEI Power Engineering International,"KEMA, energy consulting company, and Bureau Lievense, a civil engineering company, the Netherlands, have jointly developed a preliminary design for an artificial Energy Island, a concept for large-scale energy storage off the Dutch coast. The integration of electricity storage within the power supply system can enable to capture electricity in periods of low loads. It increases the technical reliability of the power supply, stabilizes the cost of electricity and helps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The creation of an island can provide coastal protection and harbor facilities, and opportunities for improving aquatic biomass and tourism. It will incorporate a pumped energy storage facility that reverses the principle on which a PAC facility functions. It will consist of a ring dyke, sealed with bentonite and enclosing an area approximately 10 km long and 6 km wide."

2002,Experimental seismic event-screening criteria at the prototype international data center,Pure and Applied Geophysics,"Experimental seismic event-screening capabilities are described, based on the difference of body-and surface-wave magnitudes (denoted as Ms:mb) and event depth. These capabilities have been implemented and tested at the prototype International Data Center (PIDC), based on recommendations by the IDC Technical Experts on Event Screening in June 1998. Screening scores are presented that indicate numerically the degree to which an event meets, or does not meet, the Ms:mb and depth screening criteria. Seismic events are also categorized as onshore, offshore, or mixed, based on their 90% location error ellipses and an onshore/offshore grid with five-minute resolution, although this analysis is not used at this time to screen out events. Results are presented of applications to almost 42,000 events with mb ≥ 3.5 in the PIDC Standard Event Bulletin (SEB) and to 121 underground nuclear explosions (UNE's) at the U.S. Nevada Test Site (NTS), the Semipalatinsk and Novaya Zemlya test sites in the Former Soviet Union, the Lop Nor test site in China, and the Indian, Pakistan, and French Polynesian test sites. The screening criteria appear to be quite conservative. None of the known UNE's are screened out, while about 41 percent of the presumed earthquakes in the SEB with mb ≥ 3.5 are screened out. UNE's at the Lop Nor, Indian, and Pakistan test sites on 8 June 1996, 11 May 1998, and 28 May 1998, respectively, have among the lowest Ms:mb scores of all events in the SEB. To assess the validity of the depth screening results, comparisons are presented of SEB depth solutions to those in other bulletins that are presumed to be reliable and independent. Using over 1600 events, the comparisons indicate that the SEB depth confidence intervals are consistent with or shallower than over 99.8 percent of the corresponding depth estimates in the other bulletins. Concluding remarks are provided regarding the performance of the experimental event-screening criteria, and plans for future improvements, based on recent recommendations by the IDC Technical Experts on Event Screening in May 1999."
2007,Fetch-limited barrier islands: Overlooked coastal landforms,GSA Today,"The barrier islands of sheltered, low-wave energy coastal environments are an important, unstudied, and previously undocumented landform category. Globally, >15,000 such sandy fetch-limited barrier islands exist, compared to only 2200 open-ocean barrier islands. Fetch-limited conditions develop in the sheltered waters of fjords, bays, barrier island lagoons, and behind coral reefs. Fetch-limited barrier islands are typically short (1 km), narrow (10-100 m), and low (1-3 m) relative to ocean barriers and can be divided into approximately equal numbers of active and inactive forms. The inactive islands are locked in by salt marshes or mangroves and are only slightly impacted in the short term by modern marine processes. The evolution of active fetch-limited barrier islands is largely driven by storm events, and the impact of these storms is strongly influenced by the presence of marshes or mangroves. Islands originate in diverse ways, including alteration of antecedent topography, spit breaching, and onshore transport of sand to marsh rims. Many are relict islands from higher Holocene and Pleistocene sea levels. The abundance of fetch-limited barrier islands is highly variable: 600 islands occur in the 2000 km2 Laguna Madre of México compared to only 65 in the 6600 km2 Pamlico-Albemarle Sound. They have a high geological preservation potential and may have been misidentified in the stratigraphic record because of a lack of appreciation of their morphology and structure. Because of unprecedented development pressure on open-ocean barrier islands, the new frontier of coastal development in the United States and elsewhere may well be these low-energy islands whose formative processes and temporal evolution are virtually unstudied."
1997,Mechanics of coherent and dislocated island morphologies in strained epitaxial material systems,Journal of Applied Physics,"A combined analytical and computational model is developed to study the mechanics of strained epitaxial island growth in typical semiconductor systems. Under certain growth conditions in systems with a film/substrate lattice mismatch, deposited material is known to aggregate into islandlike shapes with geometries having arc shaped cross-sections. A two-dimensional model assuming linear elastic behavior is used to analyze an isolated arc shaped island with elastic properties similar to those of the substrate. The substrate is assumed to be much larger than the island. Finite element analysis shows that in order to minimize the total energy, which consists of strain energy, surface energy, and film/substrate interface energy, a coherent island will adopt a particular height-to-width aspect ratio that is a function of only the island volume. It is then shown that for an island with volume greater than a certain critical size, the inclusion of a mismatch strain relieving edge dislocation is favorable. The criterion for the critical size is based on a comparison of the configurational forces acting on the edge of the island in the presence of an edge dislocation. Finally, a finite element calculation combined with an analytical treatment of the singular dislocation fields is used to determine the minimum energy island aspect ratio for the dislocated island/substrate system. The combination of the minimum energy morphology studies for the coherent and dislocated systems with the dislocation nucleation criterion gives a complete model for strained epitaxial island growth which can serve as a basis for interpretation of experiments. © 1997 American Institute of Physics."
2010,Water and wastewater management at TNPL,IPPTA: Quarterly Journal of Indian Pulp and Paper Technical Association,"Tamilnadu Newsprint and Papers Limited (TNPL) is India's largest bagasse based Integrated Pulp and Paper mill, having an installed capacity of 245,000 TPY Printing & Writing paper and poised to enhance its capacity to 4,00, 000 TPY by middle of Year 2010. It used to consume about 70,000 m3/day water and discharging 55,000 m3/day wastewater where 15,000 m 3/day being accounted for evaporation losses. The mill has decided to go for major water saving program along with pollution load reduction. Mill has implemented Superbatch™ pulping in 300 TPD Hardwood Street and modern ECF bleach operations capacities of 300 TPD hardwood and 550 TPD of bagasse pulp streets. TNPL has implemented recycling of Paper Machine Effluent after clarification, close looping Eop filtrate in hardwood fiberline operations, recycling pump sealing water and gland cooling water etc. All the above measures resulted in conserving the fresh water by 30, 000 m3/Day and brought the specific water consumption to 51 m3/Ton of Paper during December 2009 with concomitant reduction of 40% pollution load (Phase I). TNPL has drawn ambitious ZLD program to be implemented in 3 phases by 2012. Phase II includes brown loop closure in bagasse pulping operations, close looping the water circuits in gland cooling and pump sealing waters, and implementing ZLD for SRP and Energy islands. The Phase III targets at treating the acidic bleach filtrate using physico-chemical-biological pretreatment followed by membrane separation and recovering 90% of water. The sludge generated in this operation will enter appropriate stage in lime sludge cycle and filtrate to be treated with membrane process to segregate the sulphates and chlorides. The sulphates will be sent to chemical recovery and dilute brine water to be concentrated to marketable level. The evaporator condensate is proposed to be segregated into higher and lower contaminated streams and less contaminated stream to be used as DM water after desirable treatment and highly contaminated stream to be used in SRP operations. After Phase III, it is envisaged to control the treated effluent discharge level to less than 15,000 m3/day having inorganic TDS less than 1200 ppm, hence can be reused appropriately."
2008,Voltage and frequency control of offshore DFIG-based wind farms with line commutated HVDC connection,IET Conference Publications,"The paper considers a previously unreported control approach for the control of off-shore DFIG-based wind farm grid with line commutated HVDC connection. The method is applicable for wind farms based-on doubly fed induction generators (DFIGs) or generators interfaced with full-rated power electronic converters. The paper focused on DFIG- based generation. The proposed control scheme allows each wind turbine to share in the voltage and frequency control of the offshore grid. The classical approach of using droop characteristics for adjusting the voltage and frequency according to the power flow of each turbine is employed. In result, the offshore grid is controlled by each turbine using only the electrical variables of its local connection point. The proposed control approach is validated via PSCAD simulations of normal operation regime and of ride-through operation under loss of the main onshore AC grid. The results confirm very good active and reactive power sharing between wind-farm DFIGs while frequency and voltage deviations in the off-shore grid are very small."
1998,On the burn-up theory of fast soliton reactors,International Journal of Hydrogen Energy,"The basic reactor physics of a completely new nuclear fast fission reactor - the Soliton Reactor - is presented. In such a fast reactor, based either on the U/Pu-or the Th/U-233 fuel cycle, an auto-catalytically driven flux-wave, similar to a water wave on shallow water, propagates through initially fertile regions thus burning it up and producing power. Hence, a qualitatively new kind of harnessing nuclear fission energy may become possible: without transports of irradiated fuel elements, reprocessing and - according to Edward Teller - by co-location of the reactor itself and the subterranean final disposal site in a sand bed about 100m underground. Combined with the idea of an ""energy island"" soliton reactors could form the basis for a practically inexhaustible source of hydrogen for a climate-neutral energy source. © 1997 International Association for Hydrogen Energy."
1998,Propagation of Kelvin waves along irregular coastlines in finite-difference models,Advances in Water Resources,"In this paper, we examine the behavior of internal Kelvin waves on an f-plane in finite-difference models using the Arakawa C-grid. The dependence of Kelvin wave phase speed on offshore grid resolution and propagation direction relative to the numerical grid is illustrated by numerical experiments for three different geometries: (1) Kelvin wave propagating along a straight coastline; (2) Kelvin wave propagating at a 45°angle to the numerical grid along a stairstep coastline with stairstep size equal to the grid spacing; (3) Kelvin wave propagating at a 45°angle to the numerical grid along a coarse resolution stairstep coastline with stairstep size greater than the grid spacing. It can be shown theoretically that the phase speed of a Kelvin wave propagating along a straight coastline on an Arakawa C-grid is equal to the analytical inviscid wave speed and is not dependent on offshore grid resolution. However, we found that finite-difference models considerably underestimate the Kelvin wave phase speed when the wave is propagating at an angle to the grid and the grid spacing is comparable with the Rossby deformation radius. In this case, the phase speed converges toward the correct value only as grid spacing decreases well below the Rossby radius. A grid spacing of one-fifth the Rossby radius was required to produce results for the stairstep boundary case comparable with the straight coast case. This effect does not appear to depend on the resolution of the coastline, but rather on the direction of wave propagation relative to the grid. This behavior is important for modeling internal Kelvin waves in realistic geometries where the Rossby radius is often comparable with the grid spacing, and the waves propagate along irregular coastlines.; In this paper, we examine the behavior of internal Kelvin waves on an f-plane in finite-difference models using the Arakawa C-grid.

2009,Impact of increased wind integration on power flows and congestion costs in the European transmission network,"European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition 2009, EWEC 2009","One of the most important tasks rising from the ambitious European targets for renewable energy is to ensure efficient grid integration of wind power. This paper, using the TradeWind approach and tools with respect to wind power scenarios and power flow simulation, analyses the impact of high wind power penetration on congestion costs between countries in the European grid. It has been shown that for low to moderate amounts of wind power in the system, wind power contributes to reducing the total bottleneck costs in the system, compared to a reference scenario were the wind power capacity is set to zero. However, as more wind power is introduced to the system, wind induced bottlenecks becomes more significant. The benefits of building a meshed offshore grid in the North Sea is assessed by comparing costs and benefits with a base case with radial connection of all offshore wind farms."
2009,Energy storage in islands - modelling Porto Santo's hydrogen system,Chemical Engineering Transactions,"Most islands depend mainly on the importation of fossil fuels for energy production. This causes economic and environmental problems. But generally, islands present a considerable potential in renewable energies. Islands that have energy sources such as hydro or geothermal energy, can easily integrate them into the power system, but those with mainly intermittent renewable energy sources (wind, solar) have to tackle the need of energy storage. In these cases, advanced energy planning should be used, The present paper intends to demonstrate the urging need of planning energy storage systems for small islands and the results of a case-study carried out in a Portuguese island. The need to store intermittent energy is an important issue in the island of Porto Santo, since it is a small and isolated network. H2RES was used to model the energy storage scenarios for this island. One scenario was chosen to evaluate the potential of hydrogen as an energy storage vector and a pilot system of two 5kW fuel cells, one electrolyser of 13 kW, and a 55 m3 storage tank was built. The main objective of this system is to produce hydrogen from electricity from wind mills that otherwise would be wasted, and to use this hydrogen for electricity during peak time.

2007,The energy island - An inverse pump accumulation station,"European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition 2007, EWEC 2007","In this paper we describe an innovative concept for an energy storage system consisting of an inverse offshore pump accumulation station (IOPAC). To store energy, water is pumped out from a reservoir, and to deliver energy, water is flowing into the reservoir passing through water turbines. The IOPAC will be stationed on an artificial island at sea, called Energy Island, consisting of a ring of dikes enclosing a 50 meters deep dredged reservoir. The proposed energy storage system will have a maximum generation capacity between 2.000 and 2.500 MW dependent on the water level. The store capacity willl be 30 GWh. These design criteria does originate from the capability of the system to handle (most of) the imbalance due to wind energy forecast errors as well as to download wind energy at night."
2004,ENSO effects on primary production off Baja California; [Efectos del ENSO en la producción primaria frente a Baja California],Ciencias Marinas,"Long-term time series of total primary production (PT) from 1969 through 2002, associated with ENSO (El Niño/Southern Oscillation) events are presented for the region off northern Baja California. PT was calculated using an empiric model in six inshore and offshore grids of the CalCOFI-IMECOCAL network in the southern California Current. In general, PT anomalies were positive from 1970 to 1975, with a period average of 0.024 GtC yr-1 for the 'study lines. PT changed to negative anomalies after ENSO 1976-77, with a decrease in productivity for at least 20 years, reinforced by the ENSO events of 1982-84, 1987-88, 1992-93 and 1997-98. Annual time series of PT anomalies show that during the ENSO events, values diminished by ∼20% in the study area. Long-term PT changes (1976-97) originated a reduction of 0.007 GtC yr-1 (∼70%), in relation to the higher production of the early 1970s (1970-75). Mean PT during 1997-98 was 0.014 GtC yr, increasing during 1999-2002 (0.023 GtC yr-1) toward similar values calculated for the early 1970s. Superposed Epoch Analysis proved the statistical association between the ENSO events and PT, with the probability of high production one year before (-1), diminishing during the key year (0), and recovering one year after (+1) the event off Baja California. Complete (1950-2002) PT time series showed greatest variance in the 1.43-year period. Small pelagic fish biomass estimated for inshore stations of lines 90 and 107 dropped below 200 × 103 tons after the 1976-77 period, with a recovering trend after 2000."

2009,Tuning and monitoring of quantum dot growth by an in situ cantilever,Physical Review B - Condensed Matter and Materials Physics,"Self-organization of quantum dots (QDs) on an in situ cantilever setup is investigated using a continuum approach. In this QD growth system, the cantilever has two functions. The first function is as a substrate of QD growth and the second is to tune and detect the morphologies of QDs. We calculate the free energy, consisting of elastic energy, surface energy, island-substrate interaction energy, wetting-layer-substrate interaction energy, and island-island interaction energy, and we analyze their contributions to the total free energy in the QD growth system. Then, we calculate the critical quantity of the deposited material, above which the QD growth system will transfer from the planar film state to the island array state, and the curvature of the cantilever during QD growth. The curvatures of the cantilever are functions of island coverage, island size, facet orientation of island, thickness of the wetting layer, and thickness of the cantilever. It is shown that the in situ cantilever setup can not only tune the morphologies of QDs by properly choosing the thickness of the cantilever but can also monitor the QD growth state with a high sensitivity. © 2009 The American Physical Society."

1997,Growth mechanisms of SiGe on (111) and (100) Si substrates,Thin Solid Films,"We present an experimental analysis of strain relaxation in SiGe/Si heterostructures which is strongly dependent on the Si substrate orientation. In particular, different driving forces for the transition from 2D towards 3D growth were evidenced. On (100) Si substrates the primary driving force for SiGe islanding is the ability to elastically relax strain on the top of the islands. At low elastic energy a small corrugation is initiated at the free surface of the SiGe overlayer which is known to lower the energy of the system. The amplitude of this corrugation increases with the accumulated elastic energy up to the formation of dislocation-free islands. The latter kinetically evolve towards plastically relaxed islands. In the same experimental conditions, the strain is at once relaxed by nucleation of dislocations on (111) Si. Dislocation-free islands were not observed in the latter case. Continuous dislocated films are formed up to compressive stresses of about -0.17 GPa (equivalent to a misfit between the SiGe layer and the Si substrate of ≈ 3%). At higher misfit energy, islands are initiated by the ability of introducing stacking faults on the edges of the islands. The study of defect nucleation processes does not permit one to explain the nucleation of misfit dislocations at lower stresses on (111) Si than on (100) Si. Based on the existing models we suggest two possible mechanisms able to explain the observed discrepancies."

2007,Offshore wind energy policies and their effects: Experiences in Denmark and the UK and prospects for the Netherlands,"European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition 2007, EWEC 2007","In several countries, faces have turned towards offshore wind energy and regulation is adapted or put in place for this new use of the continental waters. This paper investigates policies that support the implementation of offshore wind energy and the effects of policies and regulation are examined for three countries: The Netherlands, Denmark and the United Kingdom. The regulation and adaptations made for offshore generation are described, together with the possibilities for future policy and regulation to enhance the development of offshore wind power. Special attention is given to the prospects for regulation in the Netherlands. The consent procedure of the Netherlands is still the most open procedure and is a cause for inconsistencies for governmental policy, as no control of governmental expenditure has been incorporated. When combined with a selection area and anti-speculation clauses low utilisation of the offshore grid can be avoided. Site selection and control of governmental expenditure we consider could be added to the list of policy initiatives for best practices. Also, transparency of the financial burden could be broadened to transparency of the procedure, to add clarity in the criteria as part of the policy initiative for best practises."
2006,Development of an electric infrastructure at sea,"41st International Conference on Large High Voltage Electric Systems 2006, CIGRE 2006","One of the major issues in the large-scale application of wind energy at sea, is the manner in which the generated power is to be brought onshore to the high-voltage grid. This issue needs to be resolved before the construction of several large-scale offshore wind farms can truly be realised, since the costs associated with the grid connection accounting for some 10% of the capital expenditure of a offshore wind farm. A study was commissioned by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs into the full range of aspects being considered in the context of developing an offshore electricity grid. The study project consisted of separate technical, legal and physical planning constituent surveys. These surveys have formed the basis for the considerations as to preferred options and their implications in terms of actions to be taken and responsibilities to be considered by the major stakeholders. This paper discusses the engineering alternatives available for bringing large volumes of offshore wind power on shore for connection to the high-voltage grid. Furthermore the question is addressed what should be done to enable the realisation of cable infrastructure for the benefit of developing offshore wind energy under the various technical alternatives and development scenarios. As for the minimisation of market intervention, the most obvious steering role for the government to adopt would be that of exercising control via the Public Works Act and the Electricity Supply Structure Scheme. The government could possibly assume a steering role by exercising control via the Electricity Act, with the TSO being designated as the party in charge of installation and operation of cables to offshore hub platforms. The government's plans for offshore wind have been unambiguously outlined for the period up to 2010. The findings presented in this paper should enable a start being made on the detailed elaboration of the various engineering, financial, spatial, environmental, legal and administrative aspects associated with possible large-scale offshore developments beyond 2010."
2009,Towards a Zero Energy Island,Renewable Energy,"The aim of this study was to show the potential application of the available natural and alternative energy resources in Peng Chau Island, Hong Kong. The potential of different alternative energy resources was considered, such as solar, wind, tidal, wave, energy crops and MSW (municipal solid waste). The results show that some of the mentioned resources can be used very efficiently to supply the required electricity of the island whereas others are not very suitable. The analysis following a macroscopic approach is based on measured real data obtained by various government organizations. This study builds the basis of implementing renewable energy technologies on the island and gives hints to the reader that with a careful design, it is possible for the island to generate its required electrical energy on its own and almost without any CO2 emissions to the environment (except MSW, which is also discussed briefly). In the context of this study, the focus was on production of electrical energy only. Analog to the existing term ZEB (Zero Energy Building), a new term ""Zero Energy Island"" is introduced to name the same concept for islands. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

1993,Improvement of tribological properties by ion implantation,Surface and Coatings Technology,"Many different measurements confirm that ion implantation changes the friction and wear behaviour, which are the most important properties of tribological systems. Unfortunately, these properties will not always be improved. In industrial application, very often different results of the effects of ion implantation into tools or machine components can be observed, even if the same materials are used. A very important reason for this is the different stresses on the tribological systems. Our own practical experience has so far proved ion implantation to be advantageous in the fields of cutting and milling tools, injection moulds, calibration tools for plastics extrusion, punches and dies, surgical instruments, and wear parts of combustion engines. Year by year, experience of the effective industrial use of ion implantation is gained. However, many investigations of tribometers and real engines using the on-line radionuclide wear measurement technique show us more and more that we are not yet able to understand the complicated physical and chemical reasons for the changes in tribological properties. We do not have a useful theory for the wear processes, so it is not possible to deduce the effects of ion implantation. Predictions can only be made from experience, and are poorly defined. This situation is the main reason for the slow introduction of ion implantation in industry. To find a new applicable theory of friction and wear, much more attention must be given to the following aspects of fundamental importance. o 1. (1) The energy input caused by friction, which is a function of the stress and other parameters of the tribosystem, within a short time leads to the appearance of energy islands, which are statistically distributed over the surfaces. The density of energy within these tiny energy islands is very high. 2. (2) One result of these high energy densities is a mutation of the material's composition and structure within a very thin layer of less than 100 nm underneath the surface. Another result is wear. 3. (3) Ion implantation also changes the composition and structure of the bulk material close to the surface. 4. (4) Together with the wearing surfaces, the mutating compositions and structures migrate into the depth of the material. Thus there is urgent need to increase our knowledge of the tribo-induced mutations of ion-implanted materials and their influence on the tribological properties. For that reason surface analyses have to be carried out to determine the composition and structure of the materials and the mutation caused by friction and wear. Complementary sensitive wear analysis will then enable new models and theories to be developed and corroborated. This is a difficult but interesting challenge to modern physicists, chemists and engineers. © 1993."

OTEC power stations suggest the creation of such islands, mainly for power generation, but possibly also for many other complementary applications, whence the concept of the Energy Island. One of the main problems encountered by most OTEC projects is the relatively low temperature differential between the deeper waters at 5OC and the tropical surface waters at around 25""C, limiting the thermodynamic efficiency ofthe conversion plant. The Energy Island concept is to bring together on a single floating structure a variety of renewable energy conversion systems to maximise the energy production available from the diverse sources available, so that the interrelated systems can assist each other to reach greater efficiencies of conversion. The Energy Island is designed principally for tropical waters, but variants for higher latitudes can also be considered. Copyright © 2003 The Marine Technology."
2000,Orientation mediated self-assembled gallium phosphide islands grown on silicon,"Philosophical Magazine A: Physics of Condensed Matter, Structure, Defects and Mechanical Properties","Evolution of gallium phosphide epitaxial islands, grown on the (001), (111), (110) and (113) surfaces of Si by chemical beam epitaxy, has been investigated by p-polarized reflectance spectroscopy, transmission electron microscopy and atomic force microscopy. The growth nucleates as faceted three-dimensional islands on the (001) and (111) Si surfaces because of the polar nature of the heterointerface which increases the interfacial energy. A more two-dimensional- like growth mode is seen on the (110) and (113) surfaces which is attributed to the absence of charge build up at the GaP-Si heterointerface for these orientations, thereby reducing the interface energy. Islands grown on (001) Si become more faceted and larger in size with increase in growth temperature. This is due to a lower incubation time and enhanced atomic mobility at high temperatures. Wurtzite GaP has been observed to coexist with the zincblende polytype in some of the islands grown on (111) Si at 560°C. Arguments have been developed to rationalize these observations. © 2000 Taylor & Francis Ltd."
2008,Design and performance evaluation of a trigeineration system incorporating hydraulic storage and an inverted brayton cycle,Proceedings of the ASME Turbo Expo,"To bring the economic benefit of trigeneration to small-scale users without incorporating expensive components, an inverted Brayton cycle (IBC) is employed which makes use of the expander section already present in a microturbine. An air accumulator provides pressurized air, which is passed through the expander section of the same microturbine used to charge the accumulator. The air passing through the IBC is cooled due to expansion, simultaneously providing power and cooling flow. As the microturbine is indirectly fired, the flow passing through the engine or IBC can be directly vented into the household; eliminating the need for additional heat exchangers. The size of the cycle studied is on the order of 10 kW(e), suitable for a domestic household, however the system is easily scaled for larger commercial applications. The majority of the components in the system studied are 'off the shelf products. A feasibility study was conducted to ensure the proposed system is economically competitive with systems currently used, such as individual generation provided by an air conditioner, high efficiency natural gas furnace, and grid power. Simulations were run for a full year based on actual external temperature, electrical, and thermal loads for a single family detached dwelling located in Winnipeg, Canada. Performance data was generated using MatlabTM while economic performance was determined with time-based simulations conducted using SimulinkTM. The system is designed to allow energy islanding by providing for all household energy needs throughout the year, however integration with a power grid is optional. It was found the operating costs for the proposed trigeneration system in an energy islanding mode of operation were marginally higher than individual generation (A/C unit, NG furnace, grid power) during heating modes of operation, and more expensive for cooling modes of operation. The yearly energy cost for the trigeneration system exceeded the individual generation costs by 30 to 40 %, however there remains much room for improvement to the trigeneration concept. All economic data was based upon fair market energy prices as found in central Canada. Copyright © 2008 by ASME."
1985,NUMERICAL SIMULATION OF STORM SURGES INDUCED BY TROPICAL STORMS IMPINGING ON THE BANGLADESH COAST.,Proceedings of the Coastal Engineering Conference,"A vertically integrated coastal zone numerical model has been described for the simulation of the surges generated by the tropical storms striking the Bangladesh coast. The model is fully nonlinear and uses a conditionally stable explicit finite-difference scheme for solving the relevant equations of motion. The model utilizes a curvilinear boundary treatment to represent the coastline and uses a non-uniform off-shore grid spacing adjacent to the coastal boundary. This allows an increased resolution near the Bangladesh coast. Using a forcing wind-stress distribution representative of the 1970 Chittagong cyclone, the model-predicted surges are compared with the observed sea-surface elevations along the Bangladesh coast. The predicted peak surge elevation above mean sea level compares well with the observed values at Chittagong port."

The aim of the project is to achieve a self-sufficient system (""Energy Island"") fed only with bio-oil from local crops. Planned duration of the experiment is four years, and the final goal is to establish new and profitable enterprises taking advantage from a cost-effective and sustainable energy supply chain: planned activities, In fact, involve farming and oil production ventures as well as the energy Intensive food Industries already settled in the area. industrial-scale benefits will be achieved by expanding experimental plants, in line with the original concept, once satisfactory profitability has been demonstrated on small scale. Strategic principles of the project, in particular the ""short supply chain"" concept, are illustrated first. The Industrial Development Area of AragonaFavara is then examined as to its energy demand, which should be met by renewable energy. The supply side is subsequently analyzed, focusing on how a short supply chain for oleaginous crops (sunflower and rapeseed) could be structured by appointing some set-aside agricultural areas to industrial crops. Incentives and national legislation on renewable energy are presented to outline market opportunities for energy and for produced biofuel once the experimental phase is concluded. Technical details of the project are then given, with process description and an account of how the experimental plants have been sized, deriving energy and mass flow balances and estimating avoided GHG emissions within the experimental timeframe.

2009,"Systematics of the (p, n) excitation functions belonged to several isotopes at energies <60 MeV",Annals of Nuclear Energy,"Excitation functions of proton induced charge exchange reaction on nuclei between A = 11 and 238 are studied.

Islands of higher reaction yield appeared to be for nuclei with mass number A = 49, 72, 89, 109, and 139, and proton energy range from 9 to 12 MeV. The more probable occurrence of proton induced charge exchange reaction in these regions are attributed to its extra binding energy per nucleon than other nuclei. The larger contribution of pre-equilibrium processes on the neutron emission appeared on the linearity of the log(σ)-log(Ep) in some energy ranges.

2009,Reviewing optimisation criteria for energy systems analyses of renewable energy integration,Energy,"The utilisation of fluctuating renewable energy sources is increasing world-wide; however, so is the concern about how to integrate these resources into the energy systems. The design of optimal energy resource mixes in climate change mitigation actions is a challenge faced in many places. This optimisation may be implemented according to economic objectives or with a focus on techno-operational aims and within these two main groupings, several different criteria may potentially be applied to the design process. In this article, a series of optimisation criteria are reviewed and subsequently applied to an energy system model of Western Denmark in an analysis of how to use heat pumps for the integration of wind power. The analyses demonstrate that the fact whether the system in question is modelled as operated in island mode or not has a large impact on the definition of the optimal wind power level. If energy savings and CO2 emission reductions beyond the system boundary are not included in the analysis, then it is either not feasible to expand wind power to a high degree or it is conversely more feasible to install relocation technologies that can utilise any excess production. The analyses also demonstrate that different optimisation criteria render different optimal designs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
2007,A new methodology for incorporating tide gauge data in sea surface topography models,Marine Geodesy,"As part of the Vertical Offshore Reference Frames (VORF) project sponsored by the U. K. Hydrographic Office, a new model for Sea Surface Topography (SST) around the British Isles has been developed. For offshore areas (greater than 30 km from the coast), this model is largely derived from satellite altimetry. However, its accuracy and level of detail have been enhanced in coastal areas by the inclusion of not only the 60 PSMSL tide gauges with long-term records around the coasts of the United Kingdom and Ireland but also some 385 gauges established at different epochs and for different observation spans by the U. K. Admiralty. All tide gauge data were brought into a common reference frame by a combination of datum models and direct GPS observations, but a more significant challenge was to bring all short-term sea level observations to an unbiased value at a common epoch. This was achieved through developing a spatial-temporal correlation model for the variations in mean sea level around the British Isles, which in turn meant that gauges with long-term observation spans could be used as control points to improve the accuracy of Admiralty gauges. It is demonstrated that the latter can contribute point observations of mean sea level (MSL) with a precision of 0.078 m. A combination of least squares collocation and interpolation was developed to merge the coastal point and offshore gridded data sets, with particular algorithms having to be developed for different configurations of coastal topology. The resulting model of sea surface topography is shown to present a smooth transition from inshore coastal areas to offshore zones. Further benefits of the techniques developed include an enhanced methodology for detecting datum discontinuities at permanent tide gauges."
1999,Distributed power from solar tower systems: A MIUS approach,Solar Energy,"One of the short-term priorities for renewable energies in Europe is their integration into communities and energy islands for local power supply (blocks of buildings, new neighborhoods in residential areas, shopping centers, hospitals, recreational areas, eco-parks, small rural areas or isolated ones such as islands or mountain communities). Following this strategy, the integration of small solar tower fields into so-called MIUS (Modular Integrated Utility Systems) is proposed. This application strongly influences field concepts leading to modular multi-tower systems able to more closely track demand, meet reliability requirements with fewer megawatts of installed power and spread construction costs over time after output has begun. In addition, integration into single-cycle high-efficiency gas turbines plus waste-heat applications clearly increments the solar share. The main questions are whether solar towers can be redesigned for such distributed markets and how to make them feasible. This paper includes the design and performance analysis of a 1.36 MW plant and its integration in the MIUS system, as well as the expected cost of electricity and a sensitivity analysis of the small tower plant's performance with design parameters like heliostat configuration and tower height. A practical application is analyzed for a shopping center with a solar tower producing electricity and waste heat for hot water and heating and cooling of spaces. © Elsevier Science Ltd."

2009,The greenpeace offshore grid report: Development drivers and benefits,"European Wind Energy Conference and Exhibition 2009, EWEC 2009","The development of an offshore grid for power transmission in the North Sea is high on the agenda of different stakeholders. This work studies the development drivers for an offshore grid and the potential benefits it would bring. Based on a scenario of 68 GW of offshore wind power capacity, statistics of aggregated power output of offshore wind farms in the North Sea are analyzed with regard to availability and variability. The different development drivers in the past, today and in the future are explored. Together with the offshore transmission needs and wind power projects as envisioned today, this leads to a conceptual offshore grid design proposal that would respond to the needs of the power market as well as to those of offshore wind energy. While today the main driver for offshore transmission infrastructure is trade, wind power will become the main driver in the future. An interconnected offshore grid would serve to transport large amounts of offshore wind power to shore while at the same time providing transmission capacity for international power trade. An interconnected grid also allows the aggregation of wind power over a large area, significantly reducing the variability of the wind power output and the resulting flexibility needs."
